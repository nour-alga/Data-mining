    "text": "Crustless Nut Free Sandwiches for On-the-Go StudentsCrustless Nut Free Sandwiches for On-the-Go Students\nApril 23, 2025\nSponsored by SunButter\nCampus dining establishments have to meet students where they are, which could be anywhere. Portable, on-the-go meals and snacks are more in demand now than ever, as busy students seek delicious foods that they can toss into their backpacks and eat at their convenience. If the food brings on a certain nostalgia, all the better.\nThe challenge for college and university foodservice is that some legacy favorites need to be updated to accommodate the growing number of students with food allergies. According to Food Allergy Resource & Education (FARE), approximately 33 million people in the U.S. have food allergies, including 27 million adults over 18. Nine major food allergens—milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and sesame—are responsible for at least 90 percent of the serious food allergy reactions in the U.S., according to FARE, which cited the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.\nWhile there is evidence that children outgrow allergies to milk, egg, wheat, and soy, allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish are generally lifelong. So while the quintessential peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the perfect snack and meal for many students, there is a growing segment of students who cannot eat one, and will probably not sit next to their friends enjoying a PB&J.\nAs these young adults attend college, they expect a safe, inclusive environment, especially at meal and snack occasions. College and university foodservice establishments have made offering a variety of allergy-friendly foods a top priority, according to the National Association of College & University Food Services (NACUFS) report, “Campus Dining: 2030 and Beyond.” Flexibility and the ability to adapt to a changing student population are important components of success for C&U foodservice. As students become more vocal about their dietary needs, operators are updating their menus to ensure safety and inclusivity.\nOne solution is SunButter Jammies™ Sunflower Butter and Jelly Sandwiches. A nutrient-rich alternative to peanut butter, sunflower butter has a rich nutty taste without the nuts and is packed with plant-based protein. Students can fuel up and go nut-free with Sunflower Seed Butter and Grape or Strawberry Jelly sandwiches in the convenient crustless format that they loved as kids and still crave.\nFor the current generation of students seeking better-for-you foods that also taste good, SunButter Jammies™ are a delicious clean label option with no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, GMOs, or high-fructose corn syrup.\nSunButter Jammies™ are ready to go wherever students want to enjoy them. Individually wrapped in a thaw and eat format, they’re perfect for grab and go, vending, campus stores, catering, athletic events, and snacking anywhere.\nFor more information on SunButter Jammies™ Sunflower Butter and Jelly sandwiches, visit here.\nYou May Also Like",
