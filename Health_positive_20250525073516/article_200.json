    "text": "SPOKANE - As costs all around us continue to rise, many residents are feeling the pinch. If you’re looking for ways to keep your energy costs lower, Avista may be able to help. The company’s My Energy Discount Program is available to nearly one in three Washington customers. Even with more than 40% of eligible customers already participating, Avista says over 89,000 additional households have yet to sign up.\nWhat Is the My Energy Discount Program?\nThe My Energy Discount Program is designed to help people keep their energy bills low, without compromising their home’s comfort. The program offers personalized monthly bill discounts for two years, making it easier for participants to manage their household costs. Unlike other assistance programs, My Energy Discount has higher income limits, meaning more people qualify. Participants can also continue to receive other forms of energy assistance, maximizing the support available to them.\nWho Can Apply?\nEligibility for the program is based on household size and income. For example, a family of four in Whitman County with a combined monthly income of $6,192 ($74,300 per year) or less before taxes qualifies for the discount.\nThe application process is straightforward and requires no paperwork. Applicants simply need to provide basic information about their household size and income. The entire process can be completed within a few minutes.\nWhy Sign Up?\nEnergy usage is higher in older and energy-inefficient homes and apartments. This can be particularly challenging for college students and rural residents with limited housing options and who often face unique financial challenges. By enrolling in the My Energy Discount Program, you can reduce your monthly expenses and free up funds for other essentials like groceries, tuition, or transportation. The program is not just about saving money; it’s about providing peace of mind and financial stability. Nearly 60,000 households are already experiencing its benefits and if you qualify, there’s no reason to miss out!\nHow to Apply\nApplying for the My Energy Discount Program is quick and easy. You can start the process online by visiting Avista’s website at www.myavista.com/myenergydiscountWA . If you prefer, you can also call Avista’s customer service team at (800) 227-9187 for assistance. If you’d like to apply or learn more in person, Avista will be at the Palouse Family Fair Walk and Roll at 820 SE South Street in Pullman on Saturday, April 26, from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m.\nDon’t hesitate – the company says there is no wait list or appointment needed to sign up and start saving.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print",
