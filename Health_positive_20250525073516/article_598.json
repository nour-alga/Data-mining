    "text": "A scientist who looks into what makes people live longer says one 'simple hack' can add three years to your life. Dan Buettner said that walking is free, requires no prescription, and can have a dramatic impact on our longevity.\nBuettner is best-known for examining Blue Zones - parts of the world where people live longer, healthier lives than any other places on earth. He said that people leading a sedentary lifestyle could add years to their lives if the simply started walking for just 20 minutes a day.\nThe NHS states that walking quickly can help 'build stamina, burn excess calories. and make your heart healthier'. Buettner called it a simple hack that lots of people can do, and it is understood to be a key part of the lifestyle in the Blue Zones he has studied.\nHe said: \"There's no pill, no supplement, there's no longevity hack that has been shown to add years to your life expectancy . But there is one simple thing that people could do to get three more years, and that is if you are sedentary, if you go from zero physical activity to just 20 minutes of walking a day, it adds three years to your life expectancy. Three years!\n\"It's a very simple hack, it costs you nothing, and we'll see you when you're 100.\" He added: \"If you’re sedentary and simply start walking 20 minutes a day, you can add 3 years to your life expectancy. No cost. No prescription. Just movement. This is the real longevity hack.\"\nHow many calories does walking burn?\nDr Timothy Burnett, an instructor of kinesiology at Oregon State University Cascades, says that the average person tends to burn 100 calories per mile. That means walking at a leisurely pace of 20 minutes per mile burns five calories a minute, so 100 calories per 20 minutes of walking.\nA fast walk that covers a mile in 12 minutes might burn 8.3 calories per minute, so almost 100 calories over 20 minutes. However, the exact number depends on a range of factors including age and weight.\nAs well as being convenient, free, and easy for most of us, researchers have uncovered a range of health benefits to walking. Harvard researchers looked at 32 obesity-promoting genes in over 12,000 people and said they were cut in half if you walked for 30 minutes a day.\nResearch by the University of Exeter involving 78 workers showed that walking can curb your desire for sugar. It showed that, even in stressful situations, workers eat only half as much chocolate as they normally would after a 15-minute walk.\nIt also cuts your risk of cancer - especially breast cancer. An American Cancer Society study that zeroed in on walking found that women who walked seven or more hours a week had a 14 per cent lower risk of breast cancer than those who walked three hours or fewer per week.\nWalking also reduces joint pain. It protects the joints — especially the knees and hips, which are most susceptible to osteoarthritis — by lubricating them and strengthening the muscles that support them.\nFinally, it boosts your immune system. A study of over 1,000 men and women found that those who walked at least 20 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week, had 43per cent fewer sick days than those who exercised once a week or less. And if they did get sick, it was for a shorter duration, and their symptoms were milder.",
