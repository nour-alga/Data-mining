    "text": "Feeding Champlain Valley uses Good Food Truck to help locals with food insecurity\nThe nonprofit organization Feeding Champlain Valley is working to maintain its presence in Burlington despite its primary location being under construction.\nIn addition to opening a location at the O'Brien Community Center in Winooski, the organization is also operating a weekly free food truck with a rotating menu.\nThe endeavor, called the Good Food Truck, is located on Pearl Street near North Winooski Avenue in Burlington.\nFeeding Champlain Valley said it is committed to meeting people where they are located, and in offering free hot meals to those who need them.\n\"It is really important to have food access, at all times, regardless of if there's construction, a blizzard,\" said Justin Pflanzaer, the culinary manager of Feeding Champlain Valley. \"People deserve the right to a hot meal. So this is our way of providing that to the community during construction.\"\nThe Good Food Truck is open from 10a.m. to noon every Wednesday. As for the food shelf itself, the satellite location in Winooski is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.",
