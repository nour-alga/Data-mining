    "text": "Michigan’s mental health report card is showing improvement.\nA national report from mental health policy organization Inseparable shows the state has done a great job staffing up its school mental health system.\nDespite a $150 million budget threat in 2024, WSJM reports the state reached 36% of recommended psychologists, nearly 60% of counselors, and just over 40% of social workers. Some gaps still remain, but Michigan has improved to one social worker for every 600 students.\nNationwide, 90% of voters say expanding mental health care should be a priority for elected officials.",
