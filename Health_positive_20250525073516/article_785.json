    "text": "Local woman with rare disease spearheading effort to educate more people about handicapped parking spots\nCLINTON, CT. (WFSB) - A local woman with a rare disease is leading an effort to draw awareness to an issue that’s important to her and others who need access to handicapped parking spots.\nAlex Bode started a charity called “Peace, Love, and Accessibility.” It will receive some of the funds raised in Saturday’s Denise D’Ascenzo Foundation Walk to Fight Rare Diseases.\nShe has a rare condition known as “Friedrich’s Ataxia.” Her brother Sam also has it.\n“Alex has been living with Friedrich’s Ataxia for I don’t even know how many years. You’re 34. 35. And really was diagnosed at age 6. And was determined. And what is amazing to me is Friedrich’s Ataxia is a slowly progressive illness which is good and it’s bad,” said their mother, Mary. “Bad because it’s progressive. It’s good because as you’re losing abilities, you know, as a family we would mourn that loss, gather ourselves up, and move on.”\nDespite her physical challenges, Alex’s mind is sharp and her desire to advocate for others in situations like hers is strong.\n“She has her Master’s Degree in social work. And she always wanted to help people. So we sat down one day and we decided that she needs to think about what she could do to help others. And we came up with the idea. Accessibility is really important to her,” continued Mary.\nThe first thing Alex did when she founded the charity was create a survey about access to handicapped spots and people’s understanding of how they are and should be used.\n“One of the first things Al did was send out a survey, um, to placard users, non-placard users, police departments and physicians. To try to gather information,” said Mary.\nCaptain Ken Cain of the Clinton Police Department was one of those who Alex asked to take the survey.\n“Surprisingly when I took it there was a lot of information in there that I wasn’t aware of. So it kind of piqued my interest and they asked for some help and I how to, how to get into police departments to get some information across and right away I thought it was a great idea and decided to sit down and hear them out,” he said.\nHe agreed to pilot a program in town to educate his officers on the handicapped spots and to bring awareness about who should and shouldn’t be using them.\n“So the officers were able to observe that some of these placards were not valid. They were there’s lifetime placards that are no longer in use that we saw on people’s vehicles. Temporary placards. We, we found people using placards that didn’t belong to them. They belonged to a deceased relative and they were continuing to use these placards,” continued Cain.\nInstead of tickets, most often those who are improperly parked will get a courtesy card put on their car that Alex created, specifying the reason they are not allowed to park in the handicapped spot.\nIt could be because the vehicle has a placard that’s expired, a lifetime placard that is no longer valid, no placard at all, or they’re blocking cross-hatched lines that offer space for the ramps to extend to allow for wheelchairs to roll out.\nSo far, Alex, her mom, and her brother have visited a dozen police departments to educate them about the parking challenges they face. Sam is part of those conversations, sharing his experiences and frustrations.\n“I help Alex with whatever she needs so I go to different police with her and my mother. And I’m very, I’m very proud of both of them,” he said.\nMary said that people using expired or borrowed placards is a bigger problem than people parking in the spots who don’t have placards.\nAny placard with a wheelchair sitting up straight means that it is expired. Also, the lifetime placards that were issued more than a decade ago are no longer valid.\nThe updated placards being issued now have a wheelchair featuring a person leaning forward.\nAlex and her team from the foundation will be at the walk Saturday and will also benefit in part from the funds raise.\nTo sign up, click HERE.\nCopyright 2025 WFSB.
