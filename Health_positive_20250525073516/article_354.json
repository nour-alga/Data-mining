    "text": "An offender with an acquired brain injury previously jailed a number of times has been placed on good behaviour bonds after turning around his life through the support of the NDIS.\nTravis Hutchinson, 27, appeared in the Warrnambool Magistrates Court on Wednesday, April 22, charged with unlicensed riding of an unregistered monkey bike and three counts of theft.\nHe had also been charged with two breaches of corrections orders.\nThe court heard at 2pm on September 30 last year Hutchinson was caught riding an unregistered monkey bike near Kennedy Street.\nHutchinson told police he was \"too lazy to walk\", that he was trying to get a licence and riding the motorbike was \"just stupid\".\nPolice also reported that Hutchinson stole items including grips and oil from a motorbike shop on October 4, took two roofing kit bags from a Garden Street address mid the same month and then took a bottle of methylated spirits from Portland Disposals on October 21.\nWhen police raided his home they found one of the kit bags.\nHutchinson also admitted prior court appearances, including him being jailed in June last year for more serious offending.\nHis lawyer said Hutchinson finished his jail term and returned to Portland but was homeless and that's when he committed the most recent offending.\nNDIS support kicks in - major changes\nHis lawyer said that since then Hutchinson had got NDIS support, had supported accommodation in Terang and had now started working on a dairy farm.\nShe said Hutchinson had committed stupid offending, he struggled to comply with his CCOs but his offending had now de-escalated, he was settled in Terang and had supports in place, which all appeared to be working as there was no new offending.\nMagistrate Kimberley Swadesir told Hutchinson that it fell to her to resentence him in relation to the corrections orders and for new offending - including stealing items from three people.\nShe said those property owners had suffered because Hutchinson wanted items that he could not afford.\nHutchinson was ordered to pay about $290 restitution to those people.\nMs Swadesir said she had considered Hutchinson's past offending, the most recent charges and the significant changes in his life including the NDIS support, his new job on a dairy farm and his accommodation.\nHutchinson was placed on three individual three-month good behaviour bonds with conditions he follow the directions of his NDIS support workers, not use illicit drugs and not offend again.",
