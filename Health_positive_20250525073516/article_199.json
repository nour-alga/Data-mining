The data demonstrates a\nWhat's mechanistically important is lorundrostat's novel approach targeting aldosterone dysregulation. Current antihypertensive therapies do not directly decrease aldosterone production, despite its established role in blood pressure elevation. This represents the first potential therapeutic specifically addressing this pathway.\nThe trial results show consistent efficacy regardless of baseline medication count (two vs. three or more), gender, or race (white and black patients). This broad efficacy profile is particularly valuable since resistant hypertension patients typically have therapeutic options.\nThe safety profile shows only modest changes to potassium, sodium, and eGFR - important parameters to monitor with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The favorable tolerability in this trial population suggests potential for use in broader applications.\nThe 15.4 mmHg absolute reduction in blood pressure is particularly notable given these patients were already on optimized antihypertensive regimens.

The efficacy across diverse patient populations suggests potential for broad market applicability if approved.\nStrategically, lorundrostat appears well-positioned as a potential first-in-class aldosterone synthase inhibitor specifically targeting hypertension. The company has efficiently advanced its clinical program, completing both the pivotal Phase 2 Advance-HTN trial and Phase 3 Launch-HTN trial with positive results reported for both.\nThe ongoing Transform-HTN open-label extension will provide additional long-term safety data, which will strengthen the regulatory package. With two completed pivotal trials showing positive results, the company appears to be positioning for a potential regulatory submission.\nThe uncontrolled and resistant hypertension market represents a significant commercial opportunity with innovation in recent years. Lorundrostat addresses an established biological pathway (aldosterone dysregulation) that current therapies don't directly target, potentially carving out a distinct position in treatment algorithms.\nWith the NEJM publication and presentation at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session, Mineralys is building important scientific awareness that could accelerate clinical adoption if lorundrostat reaches the market.\n– Significant blood pressure reductions among patients with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension treated with lorundrostat reinforce key role of dysregulated aldosterone in disease onset and progression –\n– Detailed results from the second pivotal Phase 3 Launch-HTN trial to be presented at an upcoming medical conference and published in a peer-reviewed publication –\nRADNOR, Pa., April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MLYS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone, today announced that the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the detailed results from the Company’s pivotal Phase 2 Advance-HTN trial, the first of two pivotal trials evaluating lorundrostat in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (uHTN) or resistant hypertension (rHTN). The full manuscript is titled, “Lorundrostat Efficacy and Safety in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension,” and is featured in the April 23, 2025 issue of NEJM.\nThe key data from the publication showed that lorundrostat 50 mg demonstrated a 15.4 mmHg absolute reduction and a 7.9 mmHg placebo-adjusted reduction (p=0.001), in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure at week 12. Lorundrostat worked equally well in those taking two baseline medications and those taking three or more, and in both men and women as well as in white and black patients. Lorundrostat demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with modest changes in potassium, sodium and eGFR.\n“The publication of our Advance-HTN trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine is a significant milestone that underscores both the strength of our clinical data and the potentially transformative nature of this new class of medicines that could help address dysregulated aldosterone, an unaddressed, key driver of hypertension,” stated Jon Congleton, Chief Executive Officer of Mineralys Therapeutics. “Prior studies have shown that even modest reductions in systolic blood pressure can lead to a substantial decrease in the incidence of major cardiovascular events. The blood pressure reductions with lorundrostat observed in the Advance-HTN trial are particularly meaningful given the well-established correlation between elevated blood pressure, dysregulated aldosterone production and cardiovascular risk.”\n“The significant blood pressure lowering with lorundrostat 50 mg in the Advance-HTN trial was seen in patients treated by specialists who were taking an optimized standardized antihypertensive regimen – those patients with true uncontrolled or resistant hypertension that desperately need new options to lower their blood pressure,” stated Luke Laffin, M.D., co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders in the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic and the study’s lead author. “Currently available therapies to treat hypertension do not decrease aldosterone production in the body, and we know aldosterone dysregulation is a driving factor in the blood pressure elevation of many of our patients. The findings reinforce the critical role of aldosterone in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the potential of lorundrostat to address unmet medical needs facing patients with uncontrolled or treatment-resistant disease.”\nThe NEJM publication of the detailed Advance-HTN results follows a late-breaking presentation of the data at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session & Expo (ACC.25) in Chicago on March 29, 2025, and the announcement of positive topline results from both Advance-HTN and Launch-HTN earlier in March.\nMineralys plans to provide additional data from the pivotal Phase 3 Launch-HTN at an upcoming medical conference and in a peer-reviewed publication. Additionally, the ongoing Transform-HTN open-label extension trial allows subjects to continue to receive lorundrostat and obtain additional safety and efficacy data.\nAbout Hypertension\nHaving sustained, elevated blood pressure (or hypertension) increases the risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the U.S. In 2020, more than 670,000 deaths in the U.S. included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. Hypertension and related health issues resulted in an average annual economic burden of about\nLess than\nAbout Lorundrostat\nLorundrostat is a proprietary, orally administered, highly selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of uHTN or rHTN, as well as CKD and OSA. Lorundrostat was designed to reduce aldosterone levels by inhibiting CYP11B2, the enzyme responsible for its production. Lorundrostat has 374-fold selectivity for aldosterone-synthase inhibition versus cortisol-synthase inhibition in vitro, an observed half-life of 10-12 hours and demonstrated approximately a\nIn a Phase 2, proof-of-concept trial (Target-HTN) in uncontrolled or resistant hypertensive subjects, once-daily lorundrostat demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful blood pressure reduction in both automated office blood pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Adverse events observed were a modest increase in serum potassium, decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary tract infection and hypertension with one serious adverse event possibly related to study drug being hyponatremia.\nAbout Advance-HTN\nThe Advance-HTN trial (NCT05769608) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN or rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to a standardized background treatment of two or three antihypertensive medications in adult subjects. Subjects who met screening criteria had their existing hypertension medications discontinued and started on a standard regimen of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a diuretic, if previously on two medications, or a standard regimen of ARB, diuretic and calcium channel blocker if previously on three to five medications. Subjects who remained hypertensive despite the standardized regimen were then randomized into three cohorts and treated for twelve weeks: lorundrostat 50 mg once-daily (QD), lorundrostat 50 mg QD and an option to titrate to 100 mg QD at week four based on defined criteria, or placebo. The trial’s primary endpoint was the change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure at week twelve from baseline for active cohorts versus placebo.\nAbout Mineralys\nMineralys Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target hypertension, CKD, OSA and other diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone.
