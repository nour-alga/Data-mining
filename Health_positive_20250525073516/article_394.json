    "text": "Kenya's Faith Kipyegon set the current official mile world record of 4:07.64 for the now-rarely run distance in 2023. PHOTO: REUTERS UPDATED Apr 24, 2025, 03:51 AM Thanks for sharing! LONDON - Kenya's triple Olympic and world 1,500 metres champion Faith Kipyegon is to attempt the first women's, unofficial sub-four minute mile in a Nike \"Breaking 4\" project following the success of Eliud Kipchoge's sub-two hour marathon.Nike said on April 23 that Kipyegon, 31, is to attempt the feat on June 26 at Stade Charlety, Paris, where she beat her own 1,500 metres world record in 2024.Full details are yet to be revealed but, as with her compatriot's 1:59:40.2 marathon in Vienna in 2019, she is likely to be aided by \"in and out\" pacers, new high-tech shoes and kit and other technological, physiological and psychological help that will mean any record would not be officially recognised.Kipyegon set the current official mile world record of 4:07.64 for the now-rarely run distance in 2023, taking almost five seconds off Sifan Hassan's 2019 mark, so would need a huge leap forward to achieve the landmark time.",
