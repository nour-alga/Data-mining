    "text": "Prevention editors say shoppers swear by these adaptive sneakers, calling them 'a lifesaver'\nShoppers swear these shoes help them walk more comfortably, thanks to patented variable friction technology.\nShoppers swear these shoes help them walk more comfortably, thanks to patented variable friction technology.\nWe all know that comfort is key when searching for the best walking shoes—especially if you struggle with mobility issues. Luckily, science-backed start up Cadense has been perfecting their brand of adaptive shoes to help. And their star product, Cadense Original Women’s Adaptive Shoes, are designed specifically to assist those with walking difficulties in getting a smoother, safer stride. According to the brand, they are the first of their kind—and many shoppers swear they are a “lifesaver” for their conditions.\nThese top-rated shoes from Cadense are specifically designed to help anyone who stumbles or shuffles—like seniors with walking difficulties, stroke patients, people with multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy, or individuals experiencing foot drop (a condition in which it’s difficult to lift the front part of the foot due to weakness or paralysis of certain muscles in your foot). Its rocker outsole features retractable nylon pucks, which both help stop skidding as well as glide over every day obstacles while walking—from uneven pavement and concrete to low-pile carpets, hardwood floors, and more—depending on what your unique step looks like.\nThe Cadense sneakers are designed with an adjustable Velcro strap, which is great for a custom fit, as well as a quick on and off. Additionally, they feature a spacious toe box and come in both regular and wide sizing to fit all types of feet—as well as five fun colorways to choose from.\nShoppers with walking difficulties swear by these shoes in the reviews, raving that they give them more confidence while on their feet. “Best shoes ever. I have mutiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis...Let me assure you, these shoes are A LIFESAVER!” one reviewer wrote. “I used to sit and ponder how to get up and walk five feet. It was exhausting...These shoes are incredible and indispensable! Not one time have I fallen in two months since I got them...I don’t dread walking, and I feel and am safe! Thank god for these shoes.”\n“I have severe drop foot in both feet,” another shopper shared. “When I saw my neurologist a few months ago she told me about the Cadense sneakers and I ordered them immediately. They are comfortable, they are light, and they make my walking much easier and safer. The idea of being able to slide my foot without getting stuck is brilliant. It is definitely a game changer for me.”\nReady to try them out yourself? The Cadense Original Women’s Adaptive Shoes are available to shop at the Cadense website for $200 a pair (and worth every penny, according to reviewers). Snag a pair in your favorite color now—and get ready to feel confident, comfortable, and safe in your walking.",
