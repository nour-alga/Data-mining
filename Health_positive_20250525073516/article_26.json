This financial boost aligns with the company's strategic shift towards becoming a leader in cell therapies, specifically targeting unmet needs in hematologic malignancies.\nThe company highlights its advancement in cell therapy through its decentralized manufacturing approach, which aims to deliver early memory cells within a seven-day timeframe from collection to delivery. This method is expected to enhance patient outcomes by providing faster and more accessible treatments.\nIn its pursuit of advanced therapeutic solutions, Galapagos has dosed its first U.S. patient in the ATALANTA-1 study of its cell therapy candidate, GLPG5101. The company has also designated mantle cell lymphoma as the lead focus for its registrational program. Plans are in place to propel GLPG5101 into pivotal trials by 2026, with the objective of obtaining regulatory approval by 2028.\nGalapagos is committed to extending the reach of GLPG5101 to a broader patient base, targeting eight different indications characterized by high unmet medical needs.
