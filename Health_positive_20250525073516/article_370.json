    "text": "New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Kaitlan Baston will serve as the interim CEO at University Hospital in Newark as the Board for the medical center search for a permanent leader. Baston replaces former University Hospital CEO and President Ed Jimenez, who served in the position since January 2023. The new interim CEO served as New Jersey Department of Health commissioner since July 25, 2023 when she was appointed by Gov. Phil Murphy. University Hospital is the only public hospital in New Jersey, and also serves as an academic medical center and the principal teaching hospital for all Rutgers Newark-based medical education, including Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and Rutgers New Jersey Dental School. The hospital is the only State-Certified Level 1 Trauma Center in North Jersey. The Rutgers board of governors voted to merge the Newark and New Brunswick medical school campuses to University Hospital last July. Batson started her career as a family physician, providing full-spectrum public service in projects all across the world. Her work consisted of public health projects in Rwanda and public maternity and trauma hospitals in the Dominican Republic. Her practice in New Jersey health care started when she began her position as the division head of addiction medicine and medical director of the Center for Healing at Cooper University Health Care. Baston founded the Center for Healing, which provides integrated pain, addiction and behavioral health care. The center also provides undergraduate and graduate medical education in addiction medicine and research. Beyond her leadership roles, Baston also taught medicine at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University as an assistant professor. She graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, obtained a master’s degree in neuroscience from Kings College, London and is dual boarded in family medicine and addiction medicine. \"Dr. Baston brings extraordinary expertise in both clinical and operational leadership. I am confident that, under her interim guidance, University Hospital will continue to advance its mission − delivering exceptional care, driving innovation, and building on a legacy of service to the community,” said Chair of the University Hospital Board of Directors Tanya L. Freeman in the announcement from the hospital. University Hospital Board of Directors, led by Chair Freeman, will continue to look for a permanent CEO while Baston serves the temporary position.
