(WDTV) - The first recovering center in Harrison County held its grand opening early Wednesday evening.\nArch Recovery Center in Quiet Dell is an in-patient comprehensive detoxification and rehab facility for drug and alcohol addiction.\nServices at the center include individual therapy, group therapy, medical supervision, and aftercare planning.\nThe center has already had 15 graduates since operations began seven weeks ago.\nExecutive Director, Lou Ortenzio, said the opening of the facility is a step in the right direction for the area, and that he’s very pleased with the success the center has already seen in its patients.\n“We know we’re making a difference,” said Ortenzio. “The camaraderie with the jobs here, the connectiveness, the bonds that are formed here — I mean, the residents who stay here on this ship for 28 days — is truly remarkable.”\nDignitaries including Secretary of State, Kris Warner and State Senator, Ben Queen were present at the grand opening.\nCopyright 2025 WDTV.
