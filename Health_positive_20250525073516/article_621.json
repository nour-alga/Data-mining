    "text": "Ele’s Place offers free support for grieving children\nLANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Each week, 160 Mid-Michigan families visit Ele’s Place in Lansing to learn how to cope with the loss of a loved one.\nInside Ele’s Place, all feelings are welcome. It’s a space that allows people to feel free and express their feelings.\n“It helps you get out of bed in the morning, sometimes that’s the hardest thing to do when you’re grieving a loved one,” said Vice Chair of Ele’s Place and past participant Kelly Preston.\n“It can actually be the silver lining and that grief is very heavy, but it can also be a blessing that you can have a place like this and something so positive can come out of something so horrible,” said Preston.\nWhile grief comes and goes in waves, children at Ele’s Place learn how to navigate their emotions.\n“Kids, through play, are able to express their emotions that they are just otherwise uncomfortable with. It’s incredible to see what a welcoming environment can do to children who really want to speak about it,” said board member Ben Rathbun.\nEle’s Place shows up for children, even when the children can’t show up themselves. Ele’s Place will literally go to children in need.\n“Ele’s Place is able to meet our students and families wherever they’re at in terms of how they’re feeling, logistically, it can be here at Ele’s Place, our physical address here, or it can be at a school,” said Preston.\nHaving more than 90 school partnerships allows Ele’s Place to help kids no matter where they are.\n“All of these things only exist because people give materials, give the money for this stuff. It helps us to reach the kids in a way that they understand,” said facilitator Amanda Weigold.\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.
