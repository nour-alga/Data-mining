    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — Virginia has emerged as a critical access point for abortion care in the South, following a wave of restrictions in neighboring states. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the Commonwealth remains the only Southern state without a ban or waiting period for abortions. A recent study from the Guttmacher Institute reveals that reported abortions in Virginia rose by more than 16% between 2023 and 2024. In contrast, states that have implemented 6-week, 12-week or complete bans, or tight restrictions , have seen notable declines. The data also shows Virginia has the highest number of abortions provided in the country. Advocates on both sides of the issue say the uptick is largely driven by out-of-state patients seeking care unavailable closer to home. That trend has sparked a polarizing debate. Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation, sees the increase as a troubling sign. “It’s devastating to watch these out-of-state women come to the Commonwealth to get their abortions,” Cobb said. “We should be a state that stands for human life. Children are a blessing — our future doctors, lawyers, inventors.” On the other side, Rae Pickett with the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood argues that abortion is a healthcare decision that shouldn’t depend on geography. “This is not a destination — people are not going on a field trip or vacation,” Pickett said. “They’re traveling thousands of miles, states away, because they have no other choice.” According to Pickett, the percentage of patients coming from outside Virginia to Planned Parenthood jumped from just 2% to around 30% in roughly a year. Today, that number hovers near 25%. She said they saw a large jump after Florida implemented its 6-week ban. “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agrees that the best and safest healthcare is delivered free from political interference,” Pickett added. “So, any type of care you receive that’s medically accurate, evidence-based from your provider is going to be better than anything you could find without that support.” Both Cobb and Pickett shared messages for those grappling with decisions about reproductive health. “They may regret their decision,” Cobb said. “I’d love to help them find a network of support, or, if they choose, to place the child for adoption, help them find a family that’s desperately waiting.” Pickett emphasized compassion and autonomy: “No matter how someone decides to end their pregnancy, there are people who love them, who support them.” While Virginia currently allows abortions without many of the restrictions seen in nearby states, that could change. Abortion rights are not yet guaranteed in the state’s constitution — but that could be up to voters soon. Next year, Virginians will decide whether to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WRIC ABC 8News.",
