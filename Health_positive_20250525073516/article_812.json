    "text": "Known as the beauty brand recognized by NASA, Delavie Sciences is reaching beyond the stars for its ingredients and products. Founded in October 2022 by longevity experts and doctors David Sinclair and Kyle Landry, the brand harnesses extremophiles or organisms grown in extreme conditions, from 5,000 feet underground all the way to space. Delavie means “of life” in French. “We take things from other life forms to improve our own life,” says Landry.\nIts latest proprietary advancement, Hydrolytic Enzyme Complex (HEC), is sourced from a fungus grown at temperatures well over 130 degrees Fahrenheit. The enzymes it produces are great for cleansing skin, according to Landry. “ What this ingredient does is remove excess oil, specifically sebum, which can lead to breakouts and pimples,” he says. “It also helps firm and tighten the skin while supporting the health of your skin’s microbiome .”\nAccording to the brand’s clinical trials, HEC has been proven to remove 77% of facial sebum after application, reduce scaliness 46% in a single use and improve skin elasticity up to 39%. Given its functionality, naturally Delavie Sciences has incorporated it into a forthcoming line of cleansing products called layerOne. Launching this summer, the collection will consist of a face wash and toner.\nDelavie Sciences arrived on the market with $125 bestseller Aeonia Age Defying Serum. Intended as a pilot project, the product generated nearly $500,000 in sales in a few months. The second product, $75 Aeonia Eye Refresh, was released in February 2023 and sold out in just a few hours. The next year and a half was dedicated to developing $125 Aeonia Gentle Age Defying Serum, released at the end of 2023, and $100 Aeonia Sculpting Cream, released in November 2024. The brand saw a 61% revenue increase in 2024 and is gearing up for a 155% revenue surge in 2025.\nDelavie Sciences co-founder Kyle Landry As a science-heavy brand, podcasts have helped explain the background and benefits of Delavie Sciences. Landry has appeared on episodes of “The Skinny Confidential Him & Her,” “Blonde Files,” “Well with Arielle Lore,” “Pursuit of Wellness,” “The Art of Being Well” and “Success Story.” Testimonies and clinical studies have been essential as well. Delavie Sciences discloses almost all of its clinical data on its website.\nClinical brands are gaining traction with beauty consumers. According to a 2023 survey by management consultancy McKinsey & Co., 63% of skincare consumers in the United States consider clinical efficacy important when choosing a brand, and consumers are 60% more likely to trust brands that back their claims with scientific data.\nDelavie Sciences’ Aeonia line is powered by Bacillus Lysate, an antioxidant derived from Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium identified by NASA in the late 1990s. Bacillus Lysate absorbs ultraviolet radiation and can increase SPF 30 sunscreen by 22% to 33%, according to a study Delavie Sciences published in the journal Cosmetics in October 2023. It’s the first biological cosmetic ingredient to be recognized as Certified Space Technology by the Space Foundation.\nBacillus Lysate has been licensed for use in other beauty products. Landry shares some of the biggest names in the beauty business use it primarily in sunscreens, but in shampoos and lip glosses, too. He says, “There’s an innovation vacuum in the industry, we fill that.”\nLandry was going to take a similar SPF route with Delavie Sciences, but discovered longevity properties also linked to the ingredient. It stimulates skin rejuvenation, sirtuin activity and moisture by boosting hyaluronic acid production more than 200%. Landry says, “ Based on our background and the journey to get there we said, ‘Hey, let’s try to make something that really impacts skin health.’”\nGiven the moisturizing abilities of its products, Delavie Sciences’ customers are largely in the 45- and 65-year-old age range. Landry notes, however, that young people are buying the products for preventative measures. He says, “Even with luxury pricing, they value the protective features of our products to minimize the damage they accumulate throughout life, so they don’t really have to worry so much in the future about the fine lines and wrinkles.”\nDelavie Sciences’ Aeonia line is powered by Bacillus Lysate, an antioxidant derived from Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium identified by NASA in the late 1990s. An Aeonia sunscreen is due for launch later this year. It will combine sun protection and longevity benefits. “It’s going to be dual purpose,” says Landry. “All of the things that you would find in an anti-aging cream or a serum are going to be packed into this sunscreen.”\nDelavie Sciences has three other ingredients in development that the brand will build lines around. One of the lines will be a collection of oils and another will be body treatment products. Landry hopes that, in expanding the brand’s offerings, retail opportunities will open up.\n“ When we launched, we released one SKU at a time. It took us some time to actually have a depth of products to be attractive for retail ,” he explains. “We kind of shot ourselves in the foot there.”\nDelavie Sciences ships worldwide via its website and is available on Amazon. Landry aims to have conversations with brick-and-mortar stores along with e-commerce partners both domestic and international. He says, “Because the story and the efficacy of our products are so profound, we want to bring it to the world market.”\nDelavie Sciences plans to gain international footing is through partnering with brands in categories such as haircare and makeup. “It’s great to sell the ingredient for SPF, but we’re working with some European companies in particular who are really looking for that cross-promotion, brand development in areas that we’re not in,” says Landry. Discussing haircare and makeup, he adds, “ I really want to push into that area because it helps let the world know we’re creating amazing ingredients that are having impacts across all of beauty .”",
