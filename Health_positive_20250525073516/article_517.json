    "text": "‘Ease the burden’ | New state grants available for animal shelters\nThe grants provide money to support spay and neuter services.\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) - Animal shelters across the state were encouraged to apply for new grants.\nThe Animal Friendly grants provide money to support spay and neuter services. Their funding comes from specialty license plates that you can get for $35.\n“Making spay and neuter services more accessible benefits both pets and the community,” State Veterinarian Samantha Beaty, D.V.M. said. “By reducing the number litters of unwanted dogs and cats, we ease the burden on shelters while promoting healthier, longer lives for pets.”\nGrant amount is determined by how many animals are treated and the coverage area of the shelter.\nThe money can only be used for spay and neuter services done by licensed veterinarians in Tennessee.\nQualified shelters can apply online.\nCopyright 2025 WVLT.
