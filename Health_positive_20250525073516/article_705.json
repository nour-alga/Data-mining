    "text": "East Tennesseans hoping ban of artificial food dyes leads to healthier eating for children\nHealth and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. announced the pushing out of eight different food dyes.\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) - This week, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Food and Drug Administration, announced their plan to phase eight more food dyes out of the American food chain.\nPrevious Coverage: US health officials move to phase out artificial dyes from the food supply\n“It’s disabling our population, so for those ingredients that we can’t ban legally, we’re going to start informing Americans about what they’re eating,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a press conference Tuesday.\nKrystal Cameron is a dietitian in East Tennessee. She said these banned dyes do nothing for the food it is applied to.\n“Food dyes add a visual appeal to food. They don’t add any nutritional value, they don’t add any structural support, they just add color to the food,” Cameron said.\nFood dyes typically are found in candies, cereals and other things that are commonly consumed by children. It’s a fact that RFK Jr. did not want to overlook.\nCameron said that while studies are inconclusive, they do raise cause for concern among parents.\n“Over the last 50 years, food dyes have increased in the food intake by 500%, so a lot of studies are coming out now. They’re inconclusive, but they’re conclusive enough to start getting people on board to advocate for the reduction of food dyes,” Cameron said.\nOne East Tennessee business, The Wooden Spoon, has been making food with all organic flavors. This means no dyes and no artificial additives, which is something they consider a healthier and safer option.\n“We knew we wanted our product to be dye-free, made with real fruit’s color with real vegetables, and so we just chose that option not only for our community, but we also for our family,” Dillan Howell said.\nHowell has been making these all-natural desserts for six years. He believes their way allows people to enjoy their favorite snacks while also avoiding the dyes.\n“When you just do a little research and find out your options, I think it’s safe to say that there are plenty of availability out there with desserts like this that are colored with real fruits that are colored with real vegetables,” Howell said.\nCopyright 2025 WVLT.
