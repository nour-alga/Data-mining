    "text": "CCLA welcomes the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in OHIP v KS confirming that the gender affirming health care recommended for K.S. is an insurable service and not excluded from funding under the Ontario Health Insurance Plan.\nThe CCLA intervened in this case to ensure that essential healthcare services are funded in a non-discriminatory manner in Ontario. This decision from the Court of Appeal for Ontario is a victory for equitable and non-discriminatory healthcare funding for trans, non-binary and gender diverse people in Ontario.\nCCLA is grateful for the excellent pro bono legal services of Gregory Ko, Frank Nasca, and Olivia Evans of Kastner Ko LLP in this case.\nRead the decision from the Court of Appeal for Ontario here\nAbout the Canadian Civil Liberties Association The CCLA is an independent, non-profit organization with supporters from across the country. Founded in 1964, the CCLA is a national human rights organization committed to defending the rights, dignity, safety, and freedoms of all people in Canada.\nFor the Media For further comments, please contact us at media@ccla.org .\nFor Live Updates Please keep referring to this page and to our social media platforms.
