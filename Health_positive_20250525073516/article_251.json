    "text": "VALDOSTA, Ga. (WALB) - A South Georgia program is expanding its resources to give recovering mothers a fair chance at breaking generational cycles.\nThrough Volunteers of America, moms and expecting moms can get that help in one place.\nOne mother, Raquel Lyn, said, “I stopped drinking before for a couple years, but I went back…and I can’t do that to my girls.”\nNine months ago, Raquel Lyn was preparing for the birth of her third daughter when the guilt and depression of not being able to drink began to impact her day-to-day life. She said this caused her to lose connection with her daughters, herself and her faith.\n“But I’ve gotten it back and I feel really good,” Lyn said.\nVolunteers of America helps women like Lyn make the decision to begin their journey to recovery. They serve over 250 women and children a year by moving them to a safe environment and connecting them resources. The change begins the process of breaking the cycle of addiction for their children.\nPresident and CEO of Volunteers of America Southeast Rob Rogers said, “We also do reunification for many of the women that come in — who are court ordered, and the child is somewhere else. We work with DFCS — children and family services — to reunite those families. That’s what makes us special, honestly.”\nThrough a gift from Humana and the Humana Foundation, the VOA Southeast was able to enhance and sustainably expand the reach of its Family Focused Recovery, ensuring that mothers and children in underserved areas in Georgia gain access to treatment preparing women to graduate out of the residential treatment in a year.\nAccording to the Recovery Research Institute, about 70% of women entering addiction treatment have children. As caregivers, they say they need access to housing, day care, nutrition advice, counseling and support.\nVolunteers of America offers onsite daycare during treatment, which Rogers said is beneficial to recovery for mothers and their children.\nRogers said, “The next step is for them as a family to go back in the community with some form of outpatient care. And to continue their addiction recovery while rebuilding their family unit and relationship with family members in the community.”\nThe Pines Family Campus accepts doctor and government referrals, people like Lyn can take the first step with a self-referral.\nLyn said, “You have to want it for yourself, too. If you don’t, you’re not going to go through the program. If you really truly want it, you can do it.”\nSouth Georgia Resources:\nPines Family Campus Sheree Revels, Program Manager 229-245-8045 srevels@voase.org 305 Smith Ave., Valdosta, GA 31601 The Millennium Center Theresa Shirey, Program Manager 229-732-5602 tshirey@voase.org 96 Millennium Dr., Cuthbert, GA 39840 Have a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
