    "text": "'I don't want to forget where I came from': Fremont Police's unique co-responder program\nThe Fremont Police Department says a unique resource is helping people feel more at ease when it comes mental health crises. Since late 2023, the department has been using a co-responder to help officers on mental health-related calls.\nFremont Police says most departments with a program like this used a licensed therapist. But they use a peer support specialist instead. That's someone who is trained under a licensed therapist to provide mental health support.\nWhenever he's on the clock, you can find Jon Thomsen at the Fremont Police Station. But he's no police officer.\n\"My role here is to respond with officers, to mental health, behavioral health crises,\" Thomsen said.\nHe's a co-responder working for Lutheran Family Services.\n\"Our goal is to help people, get de-escalated, get stabilized and be able to stay in their homes, stay with their families and in the community,\" he told KETV.\nThomsen follows up with people too, even if the situation happened while he wasn't at work.\n\"Sometimes, they need to be in the hospital, I needed to be in the hospital,\" he said.\n2012 was when Thomsen first stepped foot in a psychiatric unit.\n\"My story really starts when I was growing up,\" he said. \"I learned that mental health issues aren't something that are safe to talk about.\"\nHe says that led to a long, difficult battle.\n\"I started using in junior high. And that went forward through high school,\" Thomsen said.\" I identify as an addict because I do not want to forget where I came from.\"\nAfter getting help as an adult, his therapist suggested he become a peer support specialist.\n\"That lived experience is something that you can't teach and not everybody has that,\" said Brad Negrete, assistant vice president of health and wellness services for Lutheran Family Services.\n\"We are able to have somebody here who has firsthand knowledge and understanding of what people are going through,\" said Fremont Police Deputy Chief Jennifer Birkhofer.\nFor Thomsen, it's not just a job but a purpose he doesn't take lightly.\n\"Now, I get to use that darkness as a light to walk into other people's darkness and walk with them while they find their way out,\" Thomsen said.\nThe program at the Fremont Police Department is funded by Region 6 behavioral healthcare. But starting in July, it will be funded by the Fremont Family Coalition and Nebraska Crime Commission.",
