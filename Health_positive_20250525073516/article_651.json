    "text": "One NZ’s Satellite TXT has done what says on the tin, helping out in an emergency that took place in a mobile blackspot.\n“Today around lunchtime, me and my kids were second on the scene of this accident driving home from Rotorua,” Jelena Bell messaged on Tuesday.\nHer message was accompanied by a photo of a car flipped on its side off a stretch of State Highway 5 in the Mamaku Ranges.\n“A young women distracted by her radio looked up to see she was on the wrong side of the road and swerved to avoid an oncoming car - which resulted in her going off the road,” Bell said.",
