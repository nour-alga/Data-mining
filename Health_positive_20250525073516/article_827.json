    "text": "BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KBAK/KBFX) — Houchin Community Blood Bank (HCBB) is launching two new donor appreciation promotions from April 28 through May 3, 2025, to encourage blood donations and thank community members for their contributions.\nIn collaboration with the California Living Museum (CALM), HCBB is offering a special incentive for successful blood donors during the promotional week. Donors will receive a voucher for two general admission tickets to CALM Zoo, providing an opportunity to enjoy a day among the zoo's diverse wildlife and exhibits.\nAdditionally, HCBB is introducing an exclusive \"They Not Like Us\" blood donation sticker, inspired by Kendrick Lamar's hit song, to all successful donors while supplies last.\n\"Because O blood is the most commonly used type to save lives in our community, the challenge of keeping up with demand is ever present,\" stated Shane Hubbard, Marketing and Communications Manager at HCBB. \"Right now, O and A blood types are the most needed due to demand. B and AB types are also in high demand as we work to maintain stable levels for our hospitals and emergency providers.\"\nBlood donors must be in good health, weigh at least 110 pounds, and be at least 16 years old with parent or guardian consent. A photo ID with a date of birth is required to donate.\nAppointments can be scheduled at hcbb.com/schedule or by calling (661) 323-4222. Walk-ins are also welcome.",
