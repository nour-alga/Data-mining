    "text": "- Net income for Univest Financial (\nUVSP,Financial) rose to $22.4 million in Q1 2025, a 10.3% increase year-over-year. - The company declared a 4.8% rise in its quarterly dividend, now $0.22 per share.\n- Net interest income increased by 10.3%, with a net interest margin improvement to 3.09%.\nUnivest Financial Corporation (UVSP) posted robust financial results for the first quarter of 2025, recording a net income of $22.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share. This marks a notable 10.3% increase from the $20.3 million, or $0.69 per share, reported for the same period in 2024. Contributing factors include improved interest margins and strategic financial management.\nThe company's board has approved a 4.8% increase in the quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.22 per share, payable on May 21, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 7, 2025. This increment marks the first dividend raise since May 2022, reflecting Univest's confidence in its ongoing business momentum.\nKey financial highlights include a 10.3% year-over-year increase in net interest income to $56.8 million, with an improved net interest margin of 3.09% compared to 2.88% in the first quarter of 2024. Gross loans and leases saw a year-over-year uptick of 3.9%, reaching $254.0 million, underscoring Univest's expanding loan portfolio.\nMeanwhile, total deposits exhibited a 4.0% year-over-year growth, amounting to $253.1 million. During this period, Univest also benefited from a $1.0 million tax-free bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) death benefit, enhancing its earnings per share by $0.04.\nAlthough the company faced challenges such as a 12.4% decline in non-interest income, resulting from a one-time gain in the previous year's same quarter, and increased net loan charge-offs, Univest remains well-positioned. Its strategic maneuvers to manage liquidity and enhance shareholder value reflect its resilience and proactive approach amid industry challenges.",
