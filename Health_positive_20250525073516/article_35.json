    "text": "- Rollins (\nROL,Financial) reported Q1 2025 revenues of $823 million, a 9.9% YoY increase driven by 7.4% organic growth. - Net income rose by 11.5% to $105 million, while EPS increased by 15.8% to $0.22 per diluted share.\n- Operating cash flow surged 15.3% to $147 million, aided by the strategic Saela acquisition.\nRollins, Inc. (ROL) has reported robust financial results for the first quarter of 2025, highlighting a solid start to the year. The company's revenues rose to $823 million, marking a 9.9% increase compared to the same period last year, with organic growth contributing 7.4% of this increase. Despite the negative impact of a stronger dollar reducing revenues by 40 basis points, Rollins maintained impressive growth figures.\nThe company's net income reached $105 million, up 11.5% year-over-year, while earnings per share (EPS) saw a notable rise of 15.8%, settling at $0.22 per diluted share. Additionally, Rollins showcased its financial strength with operating cash flow climbing 15.3% to $147 million.\nRollins' strategic focus on mergers and acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of Saela Holdings, LLC in April, played a significant role in its expansion strategy. This acquisition underscores Rollins' commitment to integrating new businesses and enhancing its service offerings amidst favorable market conditions.\nDespite these achievements, Rollins experienced a minor contraction in its operating margin, which decreased by 40 basis points to 17.3%, partly due to increased fleet expenses and other operational costs. Nonetheless, the company's strategic investments and robust organic growth continue to bolster its market position and future outlook.\nThe financial results for Q1 2025 hint at a strong year ahead for Rollins, as the company continues to capitalize on its diverse portfolio and the expansion of its business through strategic acquisitions.",
