    "text": "For one Survivor contestant, 13 was a lucky number.\nThat’s how many years Mitch Guerra, 34, applied to be one of the castaways competing for the $1 million prize that comes with being the sole survivor on the reality television show.\nGuerra, a physical education teacher in Waco, Texas, was 10 when he got hooked on the show during its second season. He didn’t think he would ever be cast on the show because he has a stutter. But when the sixth season included a castaway who was deaf, Guerra started to consider the possibilities.\n“It really opened my eyes to the opportunity that maybe one day I too could go and play somewhere crazy… because I saw someone who also struggled with something like me,” Guerra said.\nThe rejection was discouraging he said, but it didn’t deter him. Instead, he began pursuing activities such as running marathons and triathlons and competing in CrossFit events to challenge himself.\n“I feel like it really did show the team at Survivor that I’m willing to be vulnerable,” Guerra said. “I’m willing to do hard things, and I think that ultimately ended up helping me get on the show.”\nGuerra arrived at the Fiji beach to play in the 48 th season of Survivor, which aired Feb. 26.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Mitch Guerra (@mguerski)\nSince his arrival to the beach, Mitch has been open with his cast mates and the audience about living with a speech impediment.\nGuerra has not always felt positively about his speech impediment.\nHonesty is a virtue for Guerra, and one he brought onto Survivor. Being truthful about his stutter allows people to understand his situation and help him in the best way possible.\nThroughout season 48, he has simultaneously educated his fellow castmates and viewers about life with a speech impediment and excelled physically in the game.\nBefore the merge, Guerra carried his tribe to victory many times, saving them from elimination at tribal council.\n“It definitely painted a big target on my back, which unfortunately I didn’t want to do,” Guerra said. “But when you have the chance of potentially losing a challenge, you want to keep you and your tribe safe.”\nThe finale of Survivor 48 will air on May 21. Mitch will either be a member of the jury and help decide who will win the million-dollar prize, or he will have the chance to be named sole survivor.\nRegardless, Guerra’s dream came true after filming the show.\nHis story serves as a testament to anyone struggling with something that dreams are possible.\n“Keep trying, keep running after the things you love, and if it’s if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be, but you’ll never get there if you give up,” said Guerra.",
