    "text": "The Golden Gals Connecticut Golden Gals Connecticut, a respected family-run golden retriever breeding program, has been featured in a new spotlight article that explores their thoughtful, ethical approach to raising well-tempered dogs. Bethany, CT - Golden Gals Connecticut, a respected family-run golden retriever breeding program, has been featured in a new spotlight article that explores their thoughtful, ethical approach to raising well-tempered dogs. The article highlights co-founders Ashley and Steve Kubik’s dedication to early socialization, home-based care, and lifelong support for families adopting their puppies.\nThe piece, written in the style of a tech blogger’s semi-biographical deep dive, gives readers an inside look at how Golden Gals Connecticut sets itself apart from conventional breeders.\n“We’re not here to compete or outshine anyone,” said Ashley Kubik in the article. “We’re just trying to raise the kind of dogs we’d want in our own home. And that starts with love, patience, and doing things the right way.”\nA Spotlight on Responsible Breeding\nThe article sheds light on several key elements of the Kubiks' approach:\nHome-Based Rearing: Puppies are raised in a family environment—not kennels—surrounded by real-life sights and sounds to build confidence and adaptability.\nEarly Socialization: A structured routine of handling, exposure to new environments, and gentle stressors prepares puppies for life as family pets, service dogs, or emotional support animals.\nEthical Standards: With a strong focus on temperament, health-tested bloodlines, and responsible practices, the Kubiks emphasize quality over quantity.\nOngoing Support: Golden Gals Connecticut provides lifetime guidance to their puppy families, ensuring continued success and well-being long after adoption.\nThe feature also mentions the recent launch of the Golden Gals’ blog, which aims to educate new and aspiring pet owners on training, nutrition, socialization, and responsible care.\n“There’s so much misinformation out there,” Ashley noted in the article. “People think love is enough, but dogs need structure, early training, and consistent care. We want to give people the tools to do it right.”\nRecognition for a Mission-Driven Breeder\nThis feature article recognizes Golden Gals Connecticut as a standout example of how breeders can positively influence a dog’s life from the very beginning. With over 13 years of experience, the Kubiks continue to lead with compassion, integrity, and deep respect for the animals they raise.\nFor more information on Golden Gals Connecticut and to read the full spotlight article, please visit the website here .\nAbout Golden Gals Connecticut\nGolden Gals Connecticut is a small, family-based golden retriever breeding program in Bethany, CT.
