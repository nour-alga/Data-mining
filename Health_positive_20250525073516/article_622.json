    "text": "Intensive blood pressure reduction can reduce the risk for all-cause dementia in older adults with hypertension, a new study shows. Specifically, treating high blood pressure for as little as four years can lower the risk of dementia by about 15%, according to data on people from China.\nReducing blood pressure in study participants also cut the risk of mild cognitive impairment by about 16%, the data revealed. The report was published Monday in Nature Medicine.\nResearchers examined data from 33,995 people who were over 40 who lived with uncontrolled hypertension in rural parts of China. The team broke 163 villages into one group that received an intensive hypertension reduction program; people from another 163 villages received regular care.\nFour years later, 4.6% of people who underwent intensive blood pressure control — decreasing it to less than 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) — were diagnosed with dementia compared with 5.4% who received standard care.\nResearchers are not sure if controlling blood pressure for a longer period of time can reduce the risk for dementia even more. But the results show that people with hypertension should use antihypertensive medications, He said.\nSome research has linked dementia and hypertension, but the new study shows that treating hypertension can lower the risk for dementia.\n“Our study shows that dementia is preventable,” Jiang He, a doctor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said in a Scientific American article.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 48% of adults have hypertension.), which is blood pressure that is consistently at or above 130/80 mm Hg.\nA study out last year in The Lancet Public Health listed hypertension as the leading dementia risk factor. The report, which reflected on 27 studies about people with dementia around the world, included data spanning 1947 to 2020.",
