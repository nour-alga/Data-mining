    "text": "Living\nFasting Mimicking Diet: Lose Stubborn Belly Fat in Just 5 Days!\nIntermittent fasting comes in many forms, which makes it a great method for flexibility that can be tailored to your personal weight loss and health goals. And if you’re looking to shrink your waist, the fasting mimicking diet plan might be right for you. It’s designed specifically to reduce visceral belly fat, the harmful type that surrounds the internal organs. Here, experts reveal the weight loss benefits of a fasting mimicking diet and how to enhance results.\nWhat is the fasting mimicking diet?\nThe fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is a short-term, low-calorie, plant-based dietary protocol designed to mimic the effects of water-only fasting while still providing small amounts of food, explains Helen Messier, MD, Chief Medical and Science Officer at Fountain Life.\n“Typically done for three to five days, the diet is low in protein and carbohydrates, moderate in healthy fats and keeps caloric intake around 700–1,100 calories per day,” says Dr. Messier. “It’s structured to avoid activating nutrient-sensing pathways, which allows the body to stay in a ‘fasted’ cellular state despite nutrient intake.”\nHow fasting mimicking promotes weight loss\nFMD works by inducing a mild state of ketosis, which occurs when your body begins burning fat as an energy source, says Dr. Messier, adding that it also helps improve insulin sensitivity.\n“Since it restricts calories and proteins, it downregulates metabolic pathways that drive fat storage while preserving lean muscle,” she explains. “It also lowers inflammation and helps reprogram metabolism at a cellular level—particularly by triggering autophagy (cellular cleanup) and stem cell activation during the refeeding period.”\nHow much weight can you lose with FMD?\nWeight loss varies based on your current body composition and metabolic health, says Dr. Messier. In clinical trials, participants commonly lose five to eight pounds of body weight per fasting mimicking diet cycle. “A significant portion of this is fat mass, especially visceral fat,” she notes. “However, the real benefit lies in metabolic resetting, not just scale numbers.”\nHow to follow the fasting mimicking diet\nFMD is usually followed for five consecutive days per month, adds Trista Best, RD at Balance One Supplements. People generally start with about 1,100 calories on day one, followed by 750–800 calories on days two through five.\nThe types of food included in FMD are mostly plant-based, including healthy fats and non-starchy vegetables, says Best. Here are the specific foods she recommends including (and avoiding) on the FMD.\nFoods to eat:\n- Zucchini\n- Kale\n- Spinach\n- Arugula\n- Broccoli\n- Cauliflower\n- Cabbage\n- Celery\n- Cucumber\n- Olives and olive oil\n- Avocados\n- Macadamia nuts\n- Walnuts (small quantities)\n- Almonds (small quantities)\n- Chia or flax seeds (sparingly)\n- Tomatoes (small servings)\n- Berries (small servings)\n- Lemon/lime (for flavoring)\nFoods to avoid:\n- Bread, rice, pasta\n- Potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn\n- Beans, lentils (in large amounts)\n- Grains (unless very small amounts like quinoa)\n- Fruit juices\n- Dried fruits\n- Sweets, desserts, honey\n- Added sugars or sweeteners (even natural ones)\n- Processed snacks or fast food\n- Refined oils (canola, soybean)\n- Artificial flavors, preservatives\nHow FMD compares to other forms of fasting\nSo, how does FMD stack up against more common types of intermittent fasting like the 16:8 schedule or prolonged water fasts? According to Messier, FMD offers a safer, more sustainable option, particularly for people who may struggle with nutrient deficiencies or blood sugar instability.\n“It provides many of the same health benefits as fasting—reduced inflammation, improved glucose control, cellular rejuvenation—without total food deprivation,” she says, making it a top option for consistency.\nNow, this doesn’t necessarily guarantee that the fasting mimicking diet is suitable for everyone. While generally considered safe, Dr. Messier cautions that it may not be appropriate if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, have a history of disordered eating, are taking insulin or certain medications or are underweight or frail.\n“It’s essential that people with chronic medical conditions consult with a healthcare provider before trying it, especially if they’re already on medications that regulate blood sugar or blood pressure,” she adds.\nCopyright 2025 A360 Media\nThis story was originally published April 23, 2025 at 5:30 PM.",
