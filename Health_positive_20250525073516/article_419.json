Jetzt informieren! Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Market Poised for Expansion Across the 7MM During the Forecast Period (2025-2034) as Breakthrough Therapies Gain Traction | DelveInsight 23.04.25 23:31 Uhr Werbung The metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) market is experiencing significant growth, driven by advancements in targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and personalized medicine. The increasing prevalence of colorectal cancer, along with growing awareness of early diagnosis and treatment options, is fueling demand for innovative treatments.\nLAS VEGAS , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer, with metastasis being the leading cause of mortality among affected patients. The liver and peritoneum are the most frequent sites of distant spread. For most individuals, metastatic CRC (mCRC) remains largely incurable, with common metastatic locations including the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum.\nSeen in approximately 45% CRC patients, KRAS mutations significantly influence the prognosis and treatment outcomes. These mutations are associated with a more aggressive disease course, resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, and overall poorer survival rates.\nIn 2024, the incidence of metastatic colorectal cancer was around 294K cases across the seven major markets, with the United States reporting the highest incidence. This number is expected to rise by 2034. Surgical intervention is the mainstay for resectable CRC, while unresectable cases are typically managed with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. These conventional therapies, however, often lack specificity and can harm healthy cells, leading to additional health complications.\nThe treatment paradigm for mCRC involves multiple lines of therapy. First-line (1L) metastatic colorectal cancer treatments include combination chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and CAPEOX , alongside anti-angiogenic agents and targeted therapies like VECTIBIX and ERBITUX , with or without chemotherapy. KEYTRUDA and BRAFTOVI (in combination with ERBITUX and mFOLFOX6) are also approved for use in the first line. In the second-line (2L) setting, treatment options expand to include OPDIVO (± YERVOY), JEMPERLI, TUKYSA (± Trastuzumab), LONSURF (± Bevacizumab), and KRAZATI plus ERBITUX . For third-line (3L) therapy, specific agents such as STIVARGA and FRUZAQLA are utilized.\nLearn more about the metastatic colorectal cancer treatment landscape @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Drugs Market\nFRUZAQLA (fruquintinib) is a once-daily oral capsule developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals . It is a kinase inhibitor approved for adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously been treated with chemotherapy regimens including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, as well as anti-VEGF therapy and, for RAS wild-type patients, anti-EGFR therapy. FRUZAQLA works by selectively targeting and inhibiting VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, thereby disrupting VEGF-driven blood vessel formation and tumor growth.\nThe FDA approved FRUZAQLA for previously treated mCRC in November 2023 , followed by the European Commission in June 2024 , and Japan in September 2024—marking it as the first new targeted therapy for mCRC in more than ten years in the Japanese market.\nOPDIVO QVANTIG (nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy) is indicated for adult patients with MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. It can be used as a standalone treatment or following prior combination therapy with intravenous nivolumab and ipilimumab. This drug works by blocking the PD-1 receptor, preventing its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 to boost immune system activity against cancer cells.\nIn December 2024 , the FDA approved OPDIVO QVANTIG as a subcutaneous injection for mCRC, making it the first PD-1 inhibitor available in this form. This new route of administration offers quicker treatment delivery—just 3 to 5 minutes—compared to the traditional 30-minute intravenous infusion of OPDIVO.\nTo know more about metastatic colorectal cancer treatments, visit @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Aggressive Treatment\nDespite several advancements, the metastatic colorectal cancer drug market remains highly competitive, with significant unmet needs for durable and long-term treatment responses. Ongoing research into investigational agents like amivantamab, zanzalintinib, and vactosertib highlights the push for more effective, resistance-targeting, and tumor microenvironment-modifying therapies, signaling a dynamic and evolving future for mCRC treatment.\nKey companies such as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inspirna, Treos Bio, Cardiff Oncology, Agenus, Leap Therapeutics, Arcus Biosciences, Enterome, Tizona Therapeutics, Innovative Cellular Therapeutics , and others are currently active in the metastatic colorectal cancer drug market.\nDiscover which therapies are expected to grab major metastatic colorectal cancer drug market share @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Market Report\nAmivantamab is a bispecific antibody designed to target specific genetic alterations, especially EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Its dual mechanism focuses on inhibiting both the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and the MET receptor—two key players in cancer cell growth and survival. By binding to these receptors, amivantamab interferes with their signaling pathways, helping to overcome resistance that tumors often develop to other treatments.\nThis dual targeting not only suppresses tumor cell growth but also enhances the body's immune response, leading to greater cancer cell destruction. The drug is currently in Phase III clinical trials for treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\nZanzalintinib (XL-092) is a third-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks several cancer-related receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptors, MET, AXL, and MER. These kinases play a role in normal cell function as well as pathological processes like cancer development, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Developed by Exelixis , Zanzalintinib builds on the company's experience with cabozantinib, aiming to improve attributes like pharmacokinetic half-life. It is also in Phase III clinical trials for mCRC.\nDKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the DKK1 protein and is being developed for treating esophagogastric, gynecologic, and colorectal cancers. Initial findings from Part A of the DeFianCe trial were shared at the 2024 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. Enrollment for Part B of the DeFianCe trial (NCT05480306) concluded in September 2024 . This Phase II, randomized, open-label, controlled study is assessing DKN-01 in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer in patients previously treated with one systemic therapy. The study enrolled 188 patients, with early results anticipated by mid-2025.\nDiscover more about drugs for metastatic colorectal cancer in development @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Clinical Trials\nThe anticipated launch of these emerging metastatic colorectal cancer treatments are poised to transform the market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the metastatic colorectal cancer market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth.\nDelveInsight estimates that the market size for metastatic colorectal cancer in the 7MM is expected to grow from USD 13 billion in 2024 with a significant CAGR by 2034.
