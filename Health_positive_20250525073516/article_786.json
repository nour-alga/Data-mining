    "text": "SARA ALZAABI (ABU DHABI)\nIn the UAE, the elderly are referred to as ‘senior citizens’ — a term that reflects the country’s deep respect for those who are regarded as pillars of wisdom, experience, and cultural heritage.\nSeniors remain at the heart of the country’s development, with their rights and wellbeing protected as part of the UAE Centennial Plan 2071. An integrated system of initiatives ensure that those above the age of 60 receive the care, support, and recognition that they deserve.\nThe newly launched Barakatna initiative reaffirms a national mission to prioritise holistic care for seniors. Beyond providing the essentials, the programme empowers the elderly, upholds their privacy and independence, guarantees their access to services and information, and bolsters their connections with their families.\nBarakatna strengthens the UAE’s long-held commitment to making sure seniors lead a dignified life. The National Policy for Senior Emiratis, introduced in 2018, encompasses all such efforts with its seven pillars: healthcare, civic participation, community life, infrastructure, financial stability, safety, and future wellbeing. Federal Law No. 9 of 2019 strengthens this policy, ensuring the rights of seniors to housing, education, employment, and protection from abuse.\nA slew of initiatives for seniors were rolled out over the years.\nClinics on wheels provided free consultations. Trainings were held for caregivers. Internet literacy projects, which have so far reached over 63,000, help seniors keep up with a digitised world.\nCommunity engagement is encouraged through various activities while civic participation is supported through mentorship opportunities for retired professionals.\nInfrastructural enhancements and transportation have made public services more accessible, providing discounts and free taxi services for Emiratis over the age of 60.\nThe UAE cares for the wellbeing of its senior citizens through safety hotlines, training, and support, including community shelters and cultural programmes initiated by the Ministry of Community Development.\nPromoting a sense of belonging, certain initiatives connect seniors with the community, especially during the pandemic. When Covid-19 hit, the ‘We Are Your Family’ initiative linked up volunteers with over 14,000 seniors to alleviate the impact of isolation.\nSeveral projects — like \"Barakat Al Dar\" programme, mobile services from Al Ain City Municipality, and Abu Dhabi Police “Hope Planter Initiative”— ensure the needs of the elderly are catered to right in their homes.\nPop-up clinics organised by the Ministry of Health and Emirates Health Services have provided better healthcare access to those who live far from the cities, while big hospitals in Abu Dhabi offered a variety of home and long-term care services to senior citizens without families.\nDigital services have also better been equipped with elder-suitable features, such as grand text and screen readers.\nMoreover, taxi discounts in Abu Dhabi, free bus rides, and parking benefits in Dubai have made transport much easier for them.\nAllowances are provided to those who need them most, while various sponsorships are granted, from the Emirates Red Crescent’s initiatives to the Zayed Foundation-funded Hajj trips.\nEducation and work, with the approval of the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, are still open to retirees, while those who are vulnerable get assistance through the Zakat Fund.\nAll these efforts have created a profound impact: Senior Emiratis are among the happiest in the world — and the happiest group in the country, according to a 2024 report.",
