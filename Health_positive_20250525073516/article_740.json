    "text": "HENRIETTA, N.Y. (WROC) – Spring has arrived in full swing, and as the weather gets warmer, you might be thinking about booking a tee time. One program through UR Medicine is striving to help golfers enjoy the game over the possibility of getting injured. “About a year ago, I could notice that I was fine. But, I wasn’t 100 percent. Over the past year, we’ve been building that up,” said Bob Heumann, a local golfer. After surgery and physical therapy, Heumann turned to UR Medicine to help his recovery as well as his golf game. “I feel like I have a solid foundation to go out and be better than I was pre-injury. So, that’s been big in terms of building up strength, whereas at first, we were kind of wobbling around and doing that sort of thing. It’s been a drastic change from when I first started,” said Heumann. Each year, roughly 40,000 amateur golfers need emergency medical care across the U.S. Up to 40 percent see more common injuries like back, shoulder, or elbow pains as well as knee strains, spine, or wrist injuries. Experts at URMC’s Orthopaedics Campus at Henrietta’s Marketplace Mall are working to help golfers get out ahead of that. “We do see, from time-to-time, acute injuries. Even though they’re less common in contact sports, they do exist in golf. People don’t think of golf as being a sport with a lot of injuries. But, certainly for people who don’t have a lot of time to focus on improving the mechanics of their swing, they might have poor mechanics that can lead to a higher rate of injury. It can lead to overuse injuries,” said Dr. Peter Obourn, a primary care sports medicine physician for UR Medicine. Dr. Obourn performs risk evaluations for sports medicine injuries like within the sport of golf, and says in clinics, it’s all about improving the mechanics of your swing while working to reduce the risk of injury. “Some studies have indicated upwards of eight times the amount of body weight forces due to a golf swing. So, that’s a tremendous amount of force going through your spine during a dynamic movement, like a golf swing,” said Dr. Obourn. “Really, this has built a structure that I can follow four days a week. I don’t have to worry about it – and I know from the testing we do, I see results from that,” said Heumann. “It’s about finding a program that works for you, but it’s also tailored by professionals that know what they’re doing.” UR Medicine will see all golfers, not only those with an injury.
