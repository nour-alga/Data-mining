    "text": "What’s being called a historic partnership between two long-term care advocacy groups is requesting millions in investment dollars to assist Pennsylvania operators in recruiting and retaining workers.\nThe Pennsylvania Health Care Association and SEIU Healthcare PA announced a new collaboration at a Wednesday press conference to “solve the dire healthcare workforce challenges impacting residents across the state.”\nPHCA President and CEO Zach Shamberg said his organization has proudly partnered with various stakeholders and associations in the past, but this venture with SEIU is much different.\n“This is the first time providers and workers are teaming up on behalf of the sector to advocate for meaningful change,” Shamberg told McKnight’s Long-Term Care News on Wednesday. “When we say the long-term care continuum is in the midst of crisis, we truly mean the entire continuum — and that includes both providers and workers. Our partnership is built on the foundation of collective advocacy.”\nHe expects their work to have a trickledown effect: What benefits providers will ultimately support workers. So Pennsylvania institutions can no longer afford to work individually or in silos, he stressed.\nPart of the collaboration will involve a full-court press for a much-needed update to the budget adjustment factor, according to a Wednesday press release.\nThey’re seeking a BAF reimbursement of 0.9%, as proposed through House Bill 1310. The legislation would make an additional $140 million available to long-term care providers and “provide sustainability and predictability for providers, workers, and residents throughout the commonwealth.”\nThe BAF has long been a thorn for operators who rely on efficient financial planning.\nPennsylvania is one of five states with a budget adjustment factor — or BAF — which prompts an executive agency to cut back intended spending.\nThe state’s Department of Human Services weighs a provider’s expected per diem rate against previous state averages, which often brings rates down by 10% or so, and sometimes as much as 40%, depending on an individual providers’ geography and patient make-up.\nThe budget adjustment factor resets each quarter, leaving providers with little ability to anticipate actual payments or acquire capital for needed reinvestments in their facilities. This month, the BAF was set at 0.83, resulting in a new average loss of $50 per patient day for providers — despite having received a planned rate increase at the start of the year January.\nGoal alignment\nThe provider-union collaborative effort also will focus on strengthening the Medicaid program for residents and direct caregivers, Shamberg said. And it will push staff development initiatives, training opportunities and growing the workforce.\nThough Pennsylvania has the fifth-oldest population, other nearby states’ Medicaid reimbursement rates trump the commonwealth’s $256 per resident per day rate. By comparison, Maryland’s current reimbursement rate is $375 per day, New York’s is $299 per day and New Jersey’s is $275, according to the press release.\nFor providers in other states who may be looking to forge similar partnerships to tackle long-term care challenges, ensuring goal alignment is the first step, Shamberg asserted.\n“When we began this journey in 2022, we first brought our providers and SEIU leadership to the table to focus on two specific questions: Where do we agree, and which state issues can we tackle together?” he explained. “If associations across the country are looking to forge a similar relationship or partnership, it’s important to focus on the shared goals of both providers and workers.”",
