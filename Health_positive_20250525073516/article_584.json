    "text": "Experts give recommendations for allergy season in Laredo\nLAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - With many Laredo residents experiencing allergies this spring and summer, we consulted a medical professional about how to identify and treat these allergies.\nFor Laredoan Kelsey Salazar, she knows the allergies arrive once spring begins to bloom. She mentioned, “One of the main things I do take into account is taking Benadryl or allergy medication.“\nHealth experts, including Family Nurse Practitioner Dr. Amanda Gallardo, indicate that tree and grass pollen are common triggers for those with allergies during the warmer months.\n“We are coming up on allergy season, and we are in a transition right now. We are in spring, and it is important for the community and everyone to know allergy symptoms,“ Gallardo said.\nSome of the most common symptoms to watch out for include:\n- Stuffy or runny nose\n- Itching\n- Watery eyes\n- Sneezing\nHowever, according to Gallardo, some symptoms are not as common. “Ear pain is one because all the postnasal drip from the allergy is a reaction that creates congestion,” she added.\nFortunately, Salazar says her allergies haven’t been a big problem so far this season. She added, “It’s not to the extent that I need to go to the emergency room, thankfully.“\nWhile some may experience allergies for a few hours or days, if you have severe allergies along with the symptoms previously listed, it is advised to call your doctor.\nGallardo added, “Just stay safe, as allergies can be very irritating.” Additionally, severe allergies may lead to a sinus infection due to congestion.\nFor more headlines, click here.\nCopyright 2025 KGNS.
