    "text": "Summers County Council on Aging unveils ‘Hot and Cold Truck’\nSUMMERS COUNTY, W.Va. (WVVA) - A new truck will now allow the Summers County Council on Aging to deliver hot and cold meals around the county.\nThe Hot and Cold truck was unveiled this morning in Hinton, giving the meal delivery program a needed boost, by bringing meals to all county residents in need.\nCindy Garrett, Executive Director of Summers County Council on Aging said staff is able to keep food warm or refrigerated on further away devilries throughout the county.\nGarrett says the processes of obtaining the truck began a year ago when the staff noticed the need to keep meals at a safer temperature for longer periods of time.\n“We go into the outskirts in this vehicle and deliver meals,” said Garrett. “It’s been a tremendous thing for all the people. They get their meals, they’re good and hot or good and cold like they should be, and we’re able to go far distances.”\nThe City of Hinton and County Commission both gave the council $32,500 each to purchase the truck which would cost $70,771.\nWith the help of fundraising, they were able to purchase the vehicle and pick it up in December of 2024.\nCurrently, the Council on Aging delivers to 63 seniors daily, Monday through Friday. They also feed around 40 people daily at their Senior Center in Hinton.\nNext year they are planning to begin the process of purchasing another Hot and Cold Truck to be able to split the county in half to cut down on delivery time.\nCopyright 2025 WVVA.
