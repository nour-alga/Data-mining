Keep reading for further details.\nTeddi Mellencamp Gets Positive Update Over the last few years, RHOBH alum Teddi Mellencamp has fiercely battled melanoma. She had so much cancer on her back that she obtained a very large scar. Yet, she remained diligent about going to the doctor and taking care of herself. More so, she raised awareness about the dangers of melanoma. Then, when she had a long-lasting headache, she went to the hospital, only to learn she had brain tumors. They were not new and had been growing for around six months. After her surgery, which required her to shave her head, Teddi learned there were more tumors, and her cancer had metastasized to her lungs.\nTeddi Mellencamp – YouTube She has been undergoing treatment, but was unsure what would happen. At this point, anything was possible, and the hardest part was her children worrying about her. Teddi’s son, Cruz, was constantly checking in on her to make sure she was alive. Now, the mother of three has amazing news to share. She explained that all of her tumors have either shrunken or vanished completely. Furthermore, Teddi has just six more weeks of immunotherapy. If everything stays on a good path, her doctors believe that she will be healed.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave (@teddimellencamp)\nShe proceeded to thank everyone who has sent her love and prayers along the way.
