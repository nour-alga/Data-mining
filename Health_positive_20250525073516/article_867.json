    "text": "It might sound like science fiction, but JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon says younger generations will soon live to 120.\nIn an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News , Dimon laid out an unexpectedly hopeful forecast for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, citing massive technological progress, inheritance windfalls, and a shorter workweek made possible by artificial intelligence.\n$124 Trillion May Be Coming Their Way Dimon pointed to what he calls one of the biggest opportunities in history: the Great Wealth Transfer. According to Cerulli Associates’ 2024 report on the U.S. high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth markets, approximately $124 trillion in wealth is projected to transfer through 2048.\nDon't Miss:\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you . Still, a Feb. 16–March 1, 2024 survey by Citizens Bank found that only 41% of Gen Z respondents expect to receive any inheritance within the next five years, highlighting that the gains may not be widespread.\nDespite that, the sheer size of this transfer could dramatically alter the financial future for many Americans in their 20s and 30s.\nAI Could Reshape Life And Work During a 2023 appearance on Bloomberg TV , Dimon predicted artificial intelligence could extend human life spans well into the triple digits. \"They're probably going to live to 120,\" he said of Gen Z, adding that AI will likely \"cure some cancers.\"\nDimon also suggested the five-day workweek may become a thing of the past. With widespread AI integration in industries including finance and healthcare, future workers might only clock in 3.5 days a week, Dimon said.\nTrending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.\nIn fact, JPMorgan Chase has already begun using AI to boost efficiency across operations—its engineers have reported productivity gains of up to 20% thanks to an in-house coding assistant, according to Reuters .\nGen Z Is Making Lifestyle Trade-Offs While Dimon's outlook is rosy, many Gen Z adults are still grappling with today's financial hurdles.\nAccording to the Rochester Society , rising living costs have prompted many to postpone homeownership and opt for pets instead of kids, with average pet expenses reaching $178 a month per household.\nThey're also turning down job offers due to high commuting costs and depending on possible inheritance for long-term planning. That said, these short-term tradeoffs may fade once the generational wealth shift takes hold.\nSee Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now .\nDimon's Advice Get Off TikTok, Start Reading Dimon's success— he made $39 million in total compensation in 2024—didn't come without old-school habits.\nSpeaking in the same interview, he said, \"If you don't take care of your mind, your body, your spirit, your soul, your friends, your family, you're not going to have a great life.\"\nHe's repeatedly encouraged young people to ditch social media like TikTok and Facebook, calling them \"a total stupid waste of time,\" according to Business Insider . Instead, Dimon urged younger generations to learn from everybody, regardless of political ideology, and to keep reading and growing.\nRead Next:\nWith high-demand properties in the Midwest, Bam Capital has delivered 2.46x equity multiples in just over 3 years.
