    "text": "The company recently announced its first-quarter revenue of $73.86 million, surpassing analysts' expectations of $71.93 million. Despite a positive revenue report, the company's net income saw a decrease of $13.6 million compared to the previous quarter. This decline is attributed mainly to a $14.1 million increase in provision expenses, a $5.1 million drop in net interest income, and a $0.9 million increase in noninterest expenses. These negative factors were partially mitigated by a $4.1 million rise in noninterest income.\nChair, President, and CEO Susan Riel highlighted the company's strategic advances during the first quarter, particularly in the corporate and industrial (C&I) portfolio which saw significant growth. The C&I portfolio expanded by $109 million, or 4.3%, while total deposits increased by $146.2 million, or 1.6%. These developments underscore the company’s ongoing commitment to focusing on key business areas.
