    "text": "Jacksonville, FL - April 23, 2025 - Affordable Pet Cremation of Florida (APC-FL) is now serving pet owners and veterinary clinics across North and Central Florida. Founded by a longtime animal advocate, APC-FL provides timely, respectful, and affordable cremation services for families facing the loss of a beloved companion.\n“Losing a pet is never easy, and our goal is to make that journey a little gentler for families,” said Robert Altomare, the Founder of Affordable Pet Cremation of Florida. “Pets are family, and they deserve to be remembered with care and dignity. We’re here to support owners through that process with compassion, clarity, and respect.”\nAPC-FL offers three cremation options: private, semi-private, and communal. All cremation packages include a temporary plastic urn, a certificate of cremation, and a remembrance pin with optional upgrades featuring personalized keepsakes or cremation jewelry. They also offer clay paw prints as memorials.\nIn addition to working directly with individual pet owners, APC-FL partners with local veterinary clinics to provide bulk wholesale pricing, white-labeled cremation services, and free pick-up from veterinary offices. Home pick-up services are also available in select areas.\nBefore launching APC-FL, Altomare was actively involved in pet rescue and animal welfare efforts, including flying adopted animals to their new homes as part of the Pilots N Paws charity network. His personal commitment to animal well-being continues to shape the company’s values and service-first approach.\nThe opening of APC-FL marks a meaningful step for the North Florida community, giving pet owners and veterinarians access to a reliable partner during one of life’s most difficult moments. By offering affordable and respectful aftercare, APC-FL helps families navigate loss with dignity while supporting clinics in providing seamless, end-of-life services. Its presence also strengthens the local pet care ecosystem and highlights the importance of honoring the human-animal bond with care and compassion.\n“We built APC-FL with both families and veterinary practices in mind,” added Altomare. “Our launch reflects a commitment to making high-quality, compassionate aftercare more accessible across North and Central Florida.”\nTo learn more about Affordable Pet Cremation of Florida and to explore its cremation options, please visit http://www.affordablepetcremationfl.com or call (904) 955-8521.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Affordable Pet Cremation of Florida\nContact Person: Robert Altomare\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: (904) 955-8521\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.affordablepetcremationfl.com/",
