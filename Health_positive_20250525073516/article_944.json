The report, Safety and Health Revolution: The Role of AI and Digitalization in Work, outlines how these technologies are enhancing safety, improving worker well-being, and streamlining operations across industries.\n“The digital transformation presents major opportunities to improve workplace safety,” says Manal Azzi, Head of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Team, ILO. “Automation can ease repetitive tasks, freeing workers for more meaningful roles. But we must ensure that these tools are deployed in a way that does not introduce additional risks.”\nRobots are increasingly being used to perform hazardous tasks, assist in surgical procedures, and improve logistics, helping to lower accident rates and increase efficiency, says ILO. AI systems are also supporting safety monitoring and workload management, enabling improvements even in traditionally low-tech sectors. Despite these benefits, the ILO warns that without the right regulatory frameworks, the adoption of such technologies may create new threats for workers.\nAccording to the report, advanced robotics, virtual and augmented reality tools, wearable tech for real-time risk detection, and environmental sensors for air quality are reshaping how safety is managed on the job. These technologies help prevent accidents and reduce exposure to harmful conditions, while hybrid and remote work models have also contributed to improvements in mental health.\n“Many companies are adopting more rigorous safety measures, such as the use of technology and training programs to reduce the risk of accidents in the workplace. They are also focusing on employee training on occupational hazards and the importance of following safety policies and procedures,” Eduardo Medeiros, CEO, Welbe, tells MBN.\nHowever, the integration of technology in the workplace is not without complications. Maintenance and collaboration with automated systems can expose workers to new hazards, including mechanical failures, unpredictable robot behavior, and cyberthreats. Improperly fitted wearables or exoskeletons may introduce ergonomic issues, while over-reliance on algorithms could reduce human oversight and elevate psychological stress.\nThe report also calls attention to risks across the digital supply chain. From raw material extraction to e-waste disposal, workers at every stage face safety concerns, particularly those who power and maintain AI systems.\nRegulatory gaps are also a concern. The ILO urges national and international authorities to strengthen their frameworks to address these emerging risks. Its existing safety conventions serve as a baseline for ensuring a healthy and safe workplace in the digital age.\n“Thanks to the right actions, it is possible to guarantee better working conditions, reduce the risk of accidents, and avoid diseases related to the job or the work environment,” says Medeiros.\nSeveral governments are incorporating new measures into their labor laws, including robotic safety standards, guidelines for human-machine interaction, the right to disconnect, and rules for algorithmic management and secure platform-based work. Training programs and worker participation in the deployment of new technologies are also being prioritized as essential components of safe digital integration.\nThis global shift aligns with the goals of the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, observed on April 28, which forms part of the ILO’s Global Strategy on Occupational Safety and Health. The observance aims to raise awareness and promote advocacy for safer, healthier workplaces, emphasizing the need to make OSH a political priority, reports the United Nations.\nUnsplash",
