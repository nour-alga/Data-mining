    "text": "- Pennsylvania American Water secured over $9.5 million in PENNVEST funding for lead service line removal in New Castle.\n- The project includes a $5.6 million grant and a $4 million low-interest loan to replace approximately 550 lead service lines.\n- American Water (\nAWK,Financial), the largest regulated water utility in the U.S., continues to enhance water quality and safety.\nPennsylvania American Water has been awarded a combined grant and low-interest loan from the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) totaling $9,527,990. This funding supports the company's project to replace lead service lines in the City of New Castle, Lawrence County.\nThe initiative is aimed at removing approximately 550 identified lead water service lines, significantly enhancing water quality for local customers. The grant portion amounts to $5,565,850, while the loan is valued at $3,962,140.
