    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - A simulated airplane crash into an Albany Technical College building provided disaster training for Albany firefighters and emergency response teams. A fire and victims were staged, all part of that training.\nThis training is required every three years by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but this was the first year EMS got to train with an aircraft simulator brought in from Minnesota.\n“I’ve never seen something with such a large-scale carnage. It was great for the employees of the city just to experience what it’s like to be prepared for detrimental situations,” said Perry Ford, a volunteer victim.\nA total of 30 staged victims participated in the Plane Drill on Wednesday. (walb) Albany Airport Police Chief Gary Ethridge said while the training was a success, his biggest takeaway was that communication between all mutual aid needs to be improved.\n“The communication was a problem, but of course that’s what we’re going to work on to improve,” he said.\nRight now, Albany Airport emergency personnel are made up of 10 people. The department is triple certified in law enforcement, firefighting, and aircraft rescue firefighting.\nAccording to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association , accidents in Georgia are down 21 percent so far this year. Ethridge said the last major plane crash in Albany happened 10 years ago, but that’s not stopping them from updating disaster resources.\n“We’re looking at hopefully two new crash trucks in the very near future,” he said.\nOnce the new vehicles are purchased, they will transition from Aqueous Film-Forming Foam to Fluorine-Free Foam. The foam is used in aircraft firefighting. Experts say the Aqueous Film-Forming Foam is environmentally friendly.\nWhile there hasn’t been a plane crash or accident here at the Albany airport in several years, emergency personnel are hoping that this training can keep them prepared for the unexpected.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
