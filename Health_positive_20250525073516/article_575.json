    "text": "The best hair masks for hair growth can help repair damage and reduce shedding. Dermatologists say there are a few key ingredients you should scan the label for: proteins to strengthen, hyaluronic acid or glycerin to hydrate, and natural oils like argan or coconut oil to nourish. Sounds easy enough, but if you scroll through TikTok, you’ll end up learning about more tea tree oil-, amino acid-, and biotin-infused deep-conditioning treatments than you can count, and probably leave the app feeling more overwhelmed than when you started.\nTo help you cut through the noise, we turned to the experts—dermatologists, trichologists, and hairstylists—to find out what hair-growth masks they recommend, then had Glamour reviewers put them to the test (including me, a beauty editor with wavy, tangle-prone hair that’s still recovering from years of double-process bleach sessions). As we tested, we took into account the masks’ ingredients, scent, and the way they made our hair look and feel.\nOur top pick was the detangling and strengthening Kérastase Resistance Masque Extentioniste, but there are plenty of other hair masks on this list, including a couple of more affordable drugstore options, that can help you reach your hair growth goals.\nThe best hair masks for hair growth, at a glance\nBest Overall Hair Mask for Hair Growth: Kérastase Resistance Masque Extentioniste\nKérastase Resistance Masque Extentioniste\nSephora\nWalmart\nAmazon\n- Pros: Lightweight enough for fine- to medium-density hair types\n- Cons: May not be rich enough for thick and coarse hair types\n- Key ingredients: Creatine R, ceramides, gluco peptide, wheat protein\n- How to use: Apply to shampooed hair as a conditioner or weekly mask. Leave on for up to 35 minutes for more moisture.\nRecommended by three dermatologists, this is our top overall pick for hair health and hair growth. “This mask is excellent for long-term hair growth goals,” says Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD, a board-certified dermatologist. “It contains ceramides and maleic acid that help repair damaged hair fibers, reduce split ends, and fortify the strands, promoting stronger, longer hair over time.” Dawn Queen, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and hair transplantation fellow, says it’s perfect for those with weak or damaged hair because it keeps it healthy and strong from root to tip.\n“This mask is my personal fave among the picks on this list. Its lightweight whipped texture softens my wavy hair and eliminates tangles without sacrificing volume. I noticed that my comb glided through my wet hair easily after using this, and I experienced less breakage and shedding during the detangling process. More than anything, though, it seriously delivered on length—my hair grew almost four inches in just two months,” says one Glamour reviewer.\nBest Drugstore Hair-Growth Mask: Hask Tea Tree Oil Hair & Scalp Treatment Mask\nHasl Tea Tree Oil Hair & Scalp Treatment Mask\nWalmart\n- Pros: Drugstore price; travel-friendly size\n- Cons: Packets are reusable but not resealable, so they can be messy\n- Key ingredients: Rosemary oil, tea tree oil\n- How to use: Apply to a clean, damp scalp, working down to the lengths and ends of hair. Leave on for up to three minutes and rinse.\nA dry, flaky scalp is a known inhibitor of hair growth, but this hydrating mask will help to keep your scalp balanced and healthy, says Nazanin Saedi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in Pennsylvania. In addition to fighting dandruff, the formula is recommended for giving fine, thinning hair a boost. “This mask combines rosemary oil and tea tree oil, an ingredient that has shown success in growing and replenishing thinning hair,” says Dr. Saeidi.\nReviewers love this drugstore option’s cooling, stimulating feel, the hydration it gives their ends, and the travel-friendly packet formats, though they wish they could reseal the packages for easier use on future wash days.“I’ve noticed thinning around the crown of my head for a little over a year now, and I’ve tried a lot of different methods to try to prompt growth in the area,” says Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine Kilkeary. “I used this hair growth mask three times over the course of a month and definitely noticed a difference in how my hair looked around the crown. It’s typically quite thin, and you can see my scalp peek through in my before photo, but if you look at my after, you can see how much stronger, shinier, and more filled in it looks.”\nBest Hair-Growth Mask for Fine Hair: Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask\nOlaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask\nNordstrom\nAmazon\n- Pros: Great for encouraging growth on all hair lengths\n- Cons: May not feel moisturizing enough on thick or very damaged hair if not used with other Olaplex products\n- Key ingredients: Patented bond-building technology\n- How to use: Apply once a week to clean, damp hair from mid-lengths to ends and let sit for 10 minutes before rinsing.\nLet’s say you’re in the awkward stage of growing out a pixie, or you wish your bob was more of a lob. If that’s the case, this hair treatment from Olaplex is for you. The amount of product you’ll use will vary based on your hair length and thickness, making it ideal for even very short or very fine hair. “This mask hydrates and smooths while working deep within the hair shaft to rebuild and strengthen weakened bonds,” says Dr. Garshick. “It’s perfect for those with chemically treated or damaged hair looking to promote hair growth.”\n“I like to apply three to four pumps of this mask to my hair. Not only does it keep my ends soft and prevent them from drying out, I’ve also noticed about an inch of growth since my last haircut while using this. Not only that, but my ends look extremely shiny and healthy in my after pic, about a month-and-a-half later,” says Glamour contributor Ariel Wodarcyk.\nBest Hair-Growth Mask for Thick and Coarse Hair: Vegamour HYDR-8 Deep Moisture Repair Mask\nVegamour HYDR-8 Deep Moisture Repair Mask\nSephora\nAmazon\n- Pros: Rich, hydrating, and great for medium to thick hair types\n- Cons: Should be used sparingly on finer hair\n- Key ingredients: Karmatin (a vegan alternative to keratin and silicones), marula oil, moringa seed oil, milk thistle\n- How to use: Apply after shampooing and let sit for three to five minutes.\nThis silicone- and sulfate-free hair mask was love at first wash for me. It has a heavenly white floral scent and an extremely thick consistency that reduced my amount of hair shedding as I blow-dried. Plus, its benefits extend past washday. “[The mask] is powered by Karmatin, a vegan keratin alternative, which coats the hair to make it instantly appear thicker and doesn’t wash away with rinsing,” explains Dr. Nathan. It’s packed with marula and moringa seed oils, which smooths frizz and prevents breakage.\nThe Vegamour mask was also a favorite for our coarse, curly-haired reviewer. “My thick, curly hair felt more pliable and easy to style after just one use,” they said. In two months, their hair grew a little over two inches. They can vouch for the claim that the mask’s benefits last several days too—each time they wet their hair in the morning, they found it easier than usual to restyle.\nBest Hair-Growth Mask for Scalp Health: Jupiter Purifying Mask\nJupiter Purifying Mask\nAmazon\nDermstore\n- Pros: Great for fighting dandruff, reducing oil, and maintaining scalp health\n- Cons: May be drying if overused—stick to once- or twice-weekly use, as recommended by the brand\n- Key ingredients: Volcanic ash, argan oil, biotin\n- How to use: Massage into the scalp on dry or damp hair one to two times a week. Let sit for three to five minutes, then rinse.\nAccording to [Matt L. Leavitt, DO, FAOCD](https://www.advancedderm.com/about-us/our-providers/matthew-leavitt-do-faocd), a board-certified dermatologist in Florida, scalp health is key when it comes to hair growth, and this mask helps with just that. “If the scalp is not cared for properly, build-up from sweat and excess oils can block hair follicles, resulting in a range of issues, from inflammation to severe itching,” he says. “Jupiter’s Purifying Mask supports exfoliating the scalp to clear away dry skin and rid the scalp of any product buildup.” The mask also contains biotin, which “works to fortify the hair shaft and encourage healthy growth,” says Dr. Queen.\nWodarcyk swears by this and the [Kérastase Resistance Masque Extentioniste](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/D7sWyRTyBnUnTGdgvMMeugKWRUQhJ94o5KZoN1LkgctUo31u41TFNMsHFjv4Y5vJPEaDG23zxwcsZ81oF2P9MW1t4jeRMuSwXtrJpkDerzkYb2bkv5E6XPXVZRk2yS2oLyFdtJ4FmyVLAcuKAWaHxYEcNV4JwUaS8ExeKtQh3cEkCPJxHibQEgCpTypx954P9UNFim) duo. “This mask has a foaming, mousse-like texture. You can apply it to wet or dry hair, then shampoo and condition as usual. I used this formula once a week on my roots and my hair grew almost four inches. The first time I tried it, I applied the mask to dry, fourth-day hair, the longest my hair can go without a wash. I left it on for several minutes before shampooing and was delighted by the cooling, mild tingling sensation I felt on my scalp. It was easy to wash out, and it left my hair feeling cleaner than just a standard wash. Plus, it helped keep oil at bay for the following days—by the time day four rolled around, my roots had only a slight sheen and my scalp felt balanced. In addition to cutting down on oil, it left the hair at my crown looking and feeling fuller.”\nBest Hair-Growth Mask for Hair Shedding: Kérastase Genesis Masque Reconstituant Hair Mask\nKérastase Genesis Masque Reconstituant Hair Mask\nAmazon\nSephora\n- Pros: Works for all hair types\n- Cons: Citrus-floral scent may be overpowering for some\n- Key ingredients: Edelweiss native cells, gingerroot\n- How to use: Apply a quarter-size amount from roots to ends. Let sit for five minutes and rinse.\n“The Kérastase Genesis Strengthening Hair Mask gave my thirsty, curly hair some much-needed TLC,” says one reviewer with fine, 3B curly hair. “I let the mask sit on my wet hair for longer than the directed five minutes because I know my weakened hair could use the extra time. After I rinsed the mask out, my hair instantly felt more moisturized and was easy to detangle. I was surprised at how soft my hair felt once it was fully dry and how my usually dull hair had an extra shine after only one use. My only ‘complaint’ was the highly fragranced scent, but thankfully it didn’t dry out my hair like some parfums do.” She added that although she liked the mask, she had still expected to see more visible growth. After one month, her hair grew slightly less than an inch—still more than the average rate of hair growth.\nInside the formula, you’ll find Edelweiss native cells and gingerroot, “which deeply feed and strengthen the hair, making it more resilient and encouraging smoother, healthier strands,” says [Aanand Geria, MD, FAAD](https://www.geriadermatology.com/about/meet-the-doctor/), a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Geria Dermatology in New Jersey.\nBest Smoothing Hair-Growth Mask: Marc Anthony Grow Long Restoring Anti-Breakage Mask\nMarc Anthony Grow Long Hair Anti-Breakage Mask\nAmazon\n- Pros: Affordable and effective at smoothing frizz\n- Cons: May weigh down fine hair types\n- Key ingredients: Hydrolyzed keratin, caffeine, biotin ginseng extract, vitamin E\n- How to use: Apply to wet, clean hair. Leave on for three to five minutes and rinse.\nThis under-$10 mask is formulated to smooth the hair’s cuticle and enhance elasticity, thanks to a combination of hydrolyzed keratin and growth-promoting ingredients like caffeine and biotin. The texture is pleasantly thick, so a little went a long way on my hair type. In fact, after almost one month of use, it still looks like I’ve barely used up any of the product.\nMy hair felt soft, shiny, and had a noticeable reduction in frizz after each use, though I did notice it weighed down my volume if I applied too much. In terms of hair growth, I noticed a little over half an inch in less than one month—not bad considering the extremely low price point. If you live in a humid climate where you’re constantly battling frizz and are interested in growing your hair out, this is an excellent budget-friendly pick.\nBest Leave-In Hair-Growth Mask: K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask\nK18 Leave in Molecular Repair Hair Mask\nAmazon\n- Pros: Lightweight enough for fine hair\n- Cons: Some users find that the bottles aren’t filled to the top with product, which makes the mask less cost-effective.\n- Key ingredients: K18 peptide\n- How to use: Shampoo hair and skip conditioner. Apply one to three pumps to towel-dried hair. Do not rinse.\nThis [viral leave-in K-18 hair mask](https://www.glamour.com/story/k18-hair-mask-review) is beloved by hairstylists, influencers, and derms alike. It promises to repair hair and fight damage on hair’s molecular level in just four minutes, thanks to its patented K18 peptide technology. “It works by reconnecting broken keratin chains; restoring strength, elasticity, and smoothness to damaged hair without weighing it down,” says Dr. Geria.\nThe K18 peptide mimics the structure of actual hair, Dr. Geria notes, which helps strengthen strands that have suffered the consequences of bleach, color, and chemical treatments. Unlike some of the other masks on this list, this is a leave-in treatment; you can apply it to shampooed, towel-dried hair, then style your hair as usual.\n“The mask quickly absorbs into your hair with minimal residue and is very lightweight—moreso than a traditional conditioner or leave-in—making it a great option for finer hair like mine,” [says](https://www.glamour.com/story/k18-hair-mask-review) Glamour contributor [Bella Cacciatore](https://www.glamour.com/contributor/bella-cacciatore). “I’ve been using K18 for a few weeks now—every wash for four washes at first, as recommended by the brand, then about once a week—and the difference is pretty noticeable. My hair feels soft and smooth, and looks bouncier and healthier, especially when I blow it out. I’ve also noticed my slight waves are more defined, and my broken baby hairs near my crown are less likely to stick up straight since incorporating K18 into my routine. Basically, it’s shampoo-commercial hair in a bottle—it’s worth the price tag and the hype.”\nBest Hydrating Hair-Growth Mask: Briogeo Don’t Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Mask\nBriogeo Don’t Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Mask\nNordstrom\nAmazon\n- Pros: Cruelty-free; Black owned and founded\n- Cons: Some users find the\n[jar packaging](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/41J5Fpr3JZxa5K3fDzgFpbHcwm4ro6sM5A3soMbMeToaC9rsDHm19adR9pouPhWo2pF5tCGXZuzechrtrzJ47ZezMh332o4SsUvQkzM9x6o7kZpEdJESD3qewVufKPojEmJKrt7Cip6yDxdzDco8Do4TAsqUMivWqYTuFWCXcv5GC4WQLmHQBFQuJrqfhDRgePWtfrzxyNsAs86tHJGD)easier to use than the smaller tube. - Key ingredients: Rosehip oil, algae extract, B-vitamins\n- How to use: Apply once a week to clean, damp hair in place of conditioner. Leave on for ten minutes and rinse.\nThis mask expertly quenches dry, damaged hair while promoting strands’ strength and elasticity, thanks to its high-impact ingredient list. “Moisturizing ingredients like rosehip, almond, and avocado oil hydrate and improve hair elasticity, biotin strengthens the hair shaft making hair stronger and more resilient, and algae extract is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant,” says Dr. Queen. In addition to hydrating hair and fighting dryness, this mask is fantastic for smoothing frizzy hair and making it more manageable.\n“The before image here is from February of this year. I had just stepped out of the hair salon and dyed my hair back to dark brown after years of highlighting it. The highlights underneath did end up coming through after two months which is why my hair is now a brown (which I love!). After this hair transformation, I started incorporating the Briogeo hair mask. It’s now April and my hair feels so healthy. I’m able to blow dry it and style it without feeling like I’m drying out my ends. I’ve noticed less hair breakage and frizz. The mask has been a great addition to my haircare routine,” says Glamour senior commerce editor [Jenifer Calle](https://www.glamour.com/contributor/jenifer-calle).\nBest Hair-Growth Mask for Thinning Hair: California Naturals RE:GRO Anti-Thinning Conditioner\nCalifornia Naturals RE:GRO Anti-Thinning Conditioner\nUlta\n- Pros: Hair loss mask; cruelty-free, clean ingredient list, moisturizes without weighing hair down\n- Cons: The pump makes it difficult to use up every bit of product\n- Key ingredients: Biotin, argan oil, rosemary\n- How to use: Apply two to three pumps to clean, damp hair. Let sit for three minutes and rinse.\nIf you’re conscious about using clean ingredients in your beauty routine, we highly recommend adding this conditioner to cart. It’s formulated with 98% naturally derived ingredients, including nourishing avocado oil, nettle, caffeine, pumpkin seed oil, and rosemary. The bottle is 100% recyclable, the fragrance is food-grade, and the formula is free of things like silicones, sulfates, phthalates, and parabens—all for only $12. The founder created the product to aid with her own postpartum hair thinning and [hair loss](https://www.glamour.com/story/why-is-my-hair-falling-out-causes-of-hair-loss), at a time when she wanted to avoid harsh ingredients.\nAfter a little over a month of testing, my hair grew about an inch, and my ends looked shiny and fuller than usual. I could apply this directly to my scalp without losing volume; in doing so, I also noticed a fresh crop of baby hairs along my hairline. This works for coarse hair types as well—when my partner tried it, they were pleasantly surprised by how moisturizing it was for their thick, curly hair.\nYour hair mask questions, answered\nHow exactly do hair-growth masks work?\nAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron\nHair masks can’t spur new hair growth from the follicle, the way that antishedding treatments like minoxidil can (it’s an FDA-approved over-the-counter topical shown to [promote hair growth](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-hair-growth-products)). However, masks are great for strengthening your hair and helping it grow fuller and healthier over time. “When hair is damaged, the proteins in the strand are exposed and vulnerable to damage,” says [Robyn Gmyrek, MD](https://www.google.com/search?q=dr.+robyn+gmyrek&oq=Dr.+Robyn+Gmyrek&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDAgAECMYJxiABBiKBTIMCAAQIxgnGIAEGIoFMgYIARBFGEAyCAgCEAAYFhgeMgoIAxAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBBAAGIAEGKIE0gEHMzY4ajBqNKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, “Hair repair products help to plug any gaps and create a smoothness to make the hair look better but also protect it from further damage.” Some stimulate hair follicles using ingredients like caffeine and cayenne too.\nIn addition to incorporating the masks below into your hair care routine, you may want to ask your doctor about [supplements that support hair growth](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-hair-growth-vitamins). “I suggest an oral nutraceutical packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that nourish hair from within,” says [Matt L. Leavitt, DO, FAOCD](https://www.advancedderm.com/about-us/our-providers/matthew-leavitt-do-faocd), a board-certified dermatologist in Florida. “Scientifically backed supplement ingredients supporting hair health include [NAD](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-nad-supplements), pumpkin seed extract, taurine, saw palmetto, and [ashwagandha](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-ashwagandha-supplements).” He particularly recommends the [Xtressé Nutrient Gummies](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/MKEh7BpQXwWWLouRozfoNvqYbNgjyF8ZPU4362GtBhz9T3X2chRmpVijhHfLPQZJv3xKaChgt5fKTtHr6rGXq9ggctgtEncpA4KMQnh2ptQQTaijwwA8wdrwx3gDU21njsYr3PksRGDDjaofW9sTrLLtyVUSkA3fB), which are available in dermatologists’ offices.\nIs a hair mask or hair oil better for hair growth?\nAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron\n“A hair mask penetrates the hair shaft much quicker and helps promote hair health from within, all while conditioning the outer layer of the hair, which helps with smoothness and shine,” says Kerry E. Yates, a trichologist and founder of [Colour Collective](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2Hr9jcQ7UuVdQeRNHUg8svbwCr2tCg8by4jBRxJj1sXRxYCYfGvxxNqEFVVuzspuSZcseFQPoWMYzXiFuq7dJUovZfw7qfr1VfyeTQD9vtHp5QCtAtWr3rXes5VTxZdZAWwHP). However, only a serum can help promote new growth from the follicle.\nWhat is the difference between using a mask and a regular conditioner for hair growth?\nAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron\n“A hair mask is usually deeply hydrating, nourishing, and a bit more intensive than regular conditioner,” says Yates. While you can use a conditioner with every wash, most masks are only intended for use one to three times a week. A mask will more deeply penetrate the hair shaft, says Yates, but a conditioner is ideal if you’re looking for more lightweight moisture.\nWhat are the best DIY hair masks for hair loss?\nAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron\nIf you’re looking for a [good DIY hair mask](https://www.glamour.com/story/natural-hair-masks) to combat hair loss, look to [coconut oil](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-use-coconut-oil-for-hair). “Coconut oil is truly nature’s bond repair,” says [Neera Nathan, MD, MSHS,](https://dermskinhealth.com/meet-our-team/neera-nathan/) a board-certified dermatologist. “Studies show it may help protect hair against UV, reduce protein loss, and penetrate the hair shaft to reduce hair breakage.” To use, she recommends applying to the whole head for 30 minutes (or overnight for an extra-deep conditioning boost) and then washing hair as usual.\nMeet the experts\nAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron\n[Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD](https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md), a board-certified dermatologist[Nazanin Saedi, MD](https://plymouthmeetingdermatology.com/our-practice/nazanin-saedi-md/), a board-certified dermatologist in Pennsylvania[Matt L.
