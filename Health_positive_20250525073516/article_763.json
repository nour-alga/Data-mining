    "text": "A model with sleek cornrows and swooped edges. Photo: Getty Images\nThinning edges can be frustrating, but if you're suffering, you’re definitely not alone. Whether it's down to tight hairstyles, stress, or hormonal changes, many of us have dealt with a thinning hairline at some point. The good news? There are proven treatments and natural remedies that can help bring your edges back to life. Our experts say the solution lies in a combination of consistent care, the right nutrients, and powerhouse ingredients that support regrowth from the inside out.\nMeet the expert Kerry Yates is a trichologist and founder of Colour Collective . Ali Syed, BSc, MSc, and PhD, is the chief chemist and founder of As I Am . Teresa Song, MD , is a board-certified dermatologist at Marmur Medical . “There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but with the right mix of topical treatments, a balanced diet, and lifestyle changes, you can absolutely see regrowth,” says Kerry Yates, trichologist and founder of Colour Collective. Ready to get your hair flourishing again? Read on to uncover everything you need to know about how to regrow your edges.\nCauses of Thinning Edges Traction Alopecia \"The most common causes of thinning edges are often linked to hairstyles that create tension, resulting in traction alopecia ,\" explains Dr. Teresa Song, board-certified dermatologist at Marmur Medica.\n\"This type of hair loss is caused by prolonged or repetitive tension on the hair. Hairstyles that pull the hair tightly, such as ponytails, buns, braids , cornrows, locs, and the use of hair extensions or weaves , are frequent culprits,\" Dr. Song says. \"The constant pulling can loosen the hair shaft from its follicle, leading to hair loss, particularly along the hairline and sides of the scalp.\"\nHormonal Changes \"Hormonal fluctuations—whether from pregnancy, menopause, thyroid issues, or birth control—can wreak havoc on your hair's natural growth cycle,\" Yates says. \"These changes often shorten the growth (anagen) phase while extending the resting (telogen) phase, leading to slower growth and overall thinner-looking hair. This effect is especially noticeable around delicate areas like your edges, where hair can appear more sparse and fragile.\"\nExtreme Dieting According to Yates, aggressive or crash diets that drastically cut calories or essential nutrients can lead to hair loss. \"When the body is deprived of vital nutrients, it prioritizes essential functions and temporarily shuts down 'non-essential' processes like hair growth,\" she explains. \"This can push hair follicles into the resting phase, leading to excessive shedding and slow regrowth, particularly around the hairline.\"\nHigh Stress Levels Whether physical, emotional, or hormonal, stress can significantly impact hair health and often lead to thinning around the edges. “Stress-induced hair loss, known as telogen effluvium, disrupts the normal hair cycle and pushes more follicles into the shedding phase,\" Dr. Song says. \"This typically occurs a few months after a triggering event.\"\nYates adds that elevated cortisol levels—the body's primary stress hormone—can also force follicles into premature rest. That can increase shedding and reduce regrowth.\nProduct Buildup and Scalp Issues When it comes to keeping your hair healthy, it's important to remember that infrequent washing or overusing products like dry shampoo and styling gels can actually do more harm than good. When your scalp isn't properly cleansed, buildup can clog hair follicles, which can block healthy growth and lead to thinning around the edges.\nHow to Prevent Thinning Edges If you want to prevent thinning edges, it starts with being gentle in your haircare habits. According to our experts, the health of your edges is closely tied to how you style, care for and nourish your hair and scalp.\nAvoid Tight Hairstyles and Tension “Styles like tight braids, sleek ponytails, and glued extensions can create damaging traction over time,” says Dr. Ali Syed, chief chemist and founder of As I Am. “If braiding is necessary, try to minimize the pulling force during the process.” Dr. Song echoes this, recommending low-tension styles like loose braids, wash-and-go curls, or low buns to preserve the integrity of your hairline.\nBe Gentle With Styling Tools and Products From edge gels to hot tools, harsh practices can weaken your hair and scalp. “Limit heat-related styling and stay away from scalp scrubs,” says Yates. “Aggressive scrubs can lead to small scratches that can damage the hair follicles.” Brushing with the wrong tools can also cause inflammation and damage. “Use round-tip brushes and avoid shampoos with harsh detergents or strong cleansing claims,” Yates adds.\nA model poses backstage during London Fashion Week. Getty Images\nKeep Your Scalp and Follicles Healthy While cleansing is essential, overdoing it—especially with dry shampoos or harsh products—can lead to clogged follicles and inflammation.\n“Most people are using dry shampoo incorrectly. It is meant to be used on the hair and then brushed out, eliminating grime and product build-up along the way,” says Yates. “Ask yourself, would you leave makeup on your face for five days? That’s essentially what happens when dry shampoo sits on your scalp too long.”\nUse gentle, hypoallergenic shampoos to avoid scalp buildup.\nNourish From the Inside Out All three experts agree that a nutrient-rich diet plays a major role in hair health. Dr. Song recommends checking for common deficiencies, like iron and vitamin D, and taking supplements if needed. Yates stresses the importance of a balanced diet and exercise to reduce stress and keep follicles functioning. “Exercise boosts your metabolism and reduces stress. Incorporating activities like yoga not only relieves stress, but supports healthier hair overall,” she explains.\nHow to Regrow Edges Regrowing thinning edges takes time, consistency, and a holistic approach that targets both the internal and external factors influencing hair growth.\nA model poses backstage during the Milan Fashion Week. Getty Images\nTopicals Natural ingredients are showing real promise in supporting edge regrowth and preventing further damage: “New gels with natural ingredients like rosemary oil and bioflavonoids are helping to counteract traction forces and keep follicles healthy,” Dr. Syed explains. “These leave-on gels, such as As I Am Rosemary Edge Gel , work to support growth while soothing the scalp and reducing inflammation caused by styling tension.”\nWhen it comes to oils and natural remedies, our experts agree that ingredients like peppermint, castor, and rosemary oils are highly effective across all hair types. “ Castor oil is particularly popular in the African American community due to its moisturizing benefits,” says Dr. Song, who also recommends peppermint oil for its ability to stimulate circulation and activate follicles. For those with finer or straighter hair types, using these oils sparingly can help avoid weighing the hair down.\nAnother effective treatment for regrowing thinning edges is minoxidil, \"an over-the-counter medication that stimulates hair growth by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles and prolonging the growth phase of the hair cycle,” Dr. Song says. “It is effective for all hair types, and should be applied twice daily to affected areas for the best results.”\nLifestyle Changes But topical treatments aren’t the only answer. “Hair regrowth starts from within,” says Yates. “A balanced diet, good hygiene habits, and targeted supplements are essential for healthy hair.” Nutrient deficiencies in iron, zinc, biotin, and vitamin D can significantly impact follicle function. Dr. Syed emphasizes the importance of a nutrient-rich diet with plenty of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates to create an ideal environment for hair regrowth.\nPatience Patience is key. “It usually takes three to six months to see noticeable regrowth,” says Dr. Song, “though you may notice baby hairs as early as one to two months in.” If your edges aren't improving despite consistent care, both Dr. Syed and Dr. Song recommend seeing a dermatologist or trichologist. “Sometimes an underlying issue, like hormonal imbalance or inflammation, needs professional attention,” Dr. Song advises.\nRead more:",
