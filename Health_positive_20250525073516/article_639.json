    "text": "In a ceremony at WASA's Jhal Khanwana Water Works Station, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) of Faisalabad formally inaugurated the upgraded 5?million gallons per day (MGD) capacity water treatment plant.\nJapanese Ambassador to Pakistan Akamatsu Shuichi presided over the handover, joined by senior WASA officials and JICA representatives.\nAmbassador Akamatsu underscored the urgency of expanding Faisalabad's water infrastructure. \"As Pakistan's third largest city, Faisalabad's population growth has outpaced its historic water supply,\" he said.\n\"Between 2016 and 2019, JICA helped develop a master plan for water, sewage, and drainage through 2038. Upgrading this 19th century plant was our top priority.\"\nA grant exceeding Rs7?billion financed the rehabilitation of aging tanks, modernization of filtration systems, and replacement of transmission pipelines - tripling water output for urban and peri-urban areas.\nManaging Director WASA Aamer Aziz, represented by Deputy Managing Director Engineering Saqib Raza, praised the collaboration.\n\"Learning from Japanese engineers has elevated our technical expertise,\" Raza said. \"This facility now delivers clean water directly to more than 200,000 Faisalabad residents. The Punjab government's timely funding release was crucial to meeting project milestones.\"\nJICA's Resident Representative, Naoaki Miyata, emphasised the facility's impact on public health and sustainable development.\n\"This project advances SDG 6ensuring clean water and sanitation for all,\" he noted.\n\"We remain committed to technical cooperation that secures safe water supplies and bolsters local capacity.\"\nProject Director Ali Ahmed traced the project timeline: in March 2022 WASA established a project management unit; by year-end JICA had selected consultants and pre-qualified contractors; technical and financial bids concluded in mid-2023.\nTo align costs with loan parameters, WASA revised the project scopereducing treatment capacity from 8?MGD to 5?MGD and shortening the maintenance phase. The revised PC-1 received provincial approval in January 2025, paving the way for this month's inauguration.\nThe ceremony concluded with Ambassador Akamatsu unveiling a commemorative plaque and touring the revamped plant.\nAttendees included Deputy Managing Director Admin Shoaib Rashid.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
