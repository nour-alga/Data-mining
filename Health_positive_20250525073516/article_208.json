    "text": "Crisis Receiving Center in Henrico celebrates first year of free youth mental health support\nHENRICO, Va. (WWBT) - The Youth Crisis Receiving Center off Brook Road in Henrico County is celebrating its first anniversary.\nThe goal of the center is to help young people experiencing mental health crises.\nDirector of Crisis Services at St. Joseph’s Villa, Bob Larkin, says they serve youth aged 7 to 17 years old, and have already helped more than 150 youth avoid trips to emergency rooms.\nFamilies who wish to remain anonymous say the specialized help for their children has been invaluable.\n“She was having some thoughts of harming herself and others, and she communicated those thoughts a few different occasions, and including in writing,” one father said of his 10-year-old daughter.\nShe received treatment at the Youth Crisis Receiving Center a few weeks ago.\nWithout this resource, the E.R. is often the only other option, and that can be more traumatic for those already suffering.\n“They’re not set up to be nurturing for children,” Larkin said. “We see kids based on school bullying, pressures of school, social media. [Others] who are under pressure for sports, academics, college entrance, and they get overwhelmed. And then we’ve also seen kids on the other side that have long-standing mental health challenges, and that this just happens to be a safe place to come and kind of reset themselves.”\nLarkin says there are fewer than 10 youth crisis receiving centers in the country, and they have been able to help more than 80% of patients return home without needing a higher level of care.\n“A very quick triage assessment, a suicide assessment, and a nurse’s assessment. Once they’re deemed that they’re safe to be at our level, they also have a crisis assessment, and they get to get to see a psychiatrist through telehealth, and all that’s done within 23 hours,” Larkin said of the process.\nThe team consists of behavioral specialists, clinicians, and registered nurses.\nThanks to a grant and in partnership with Henrico County, all services are now free.\n“We have nursing 24 hours a day. We’re in operation 24 hours a day. We’re doing admissions from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day, and the staff is just incredible,” Larkin said.\n“My experience with them was absolutely amazing,” the father said. “They were compassionate, they were sensitive, they were understanding, they were encouraging.”\nAnother thing that families say they are grateful for is that there is no cap on the number of times a child can receive free mental health services and evaluations at the center.\nCopyright 2025 WWBT.
