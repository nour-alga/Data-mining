    "text": "Rowing machines provide one of the most effective low-impact exercise options to build endurance, lose weight or support whatever fitness journey you’re on. To find the best rowing machines on the market, I researched top options from brands like Concept2, Hydrow, NordicTrack and Ergatta, and spoke with an expert at USRowing to learn more about these machines. After comparing models, I found that the Concept2 RowErg emerged as the clear winner. It’s a durable machine used by collegiate athletes and beginners alike, and it’s easy to set up and use.\nWhether you’re a diehard rower or just getting started, there are a few variables to consider before buying one of these machines. For example, the type of resistance affects how the experience of rowing feels, while its profile and foldability determine whether a full-size or compact model works best in your home. Features like a big screen and rowing classes can make workouts more engaging, but they also add to the sticker price. And details like a padded seat, rail length and secure foot straps make a big difference in terms of comfort. With these things in mind, and with insights from an expert at USRowing, here are the best rowing machines you can buy today.\nBest Rowing Machine Overall: Concept2 RowErg Best Budget Rowing Machine: Sunny Health & Fitness Magnetic Rowing Machine Best Magnetic Rowing Machine: Hydrow Pro Rower Best Premium Rowing Machine: Peloton Row Best Rowing Machine For Beginners: NordicTrack RW600 Best Water Rowing Machine: Ergatta Rower Best Rowing Machine Overall A Well-Rounded Option For Beginners And Pros Alike\nConcept2 RowErg Shop At Concept2 Dimensions: 24 x 96 x 20 inches | Weight: 64 pounds | Resistance: Air | Resistance levels: N/A (Based on stroke rate) | Display: PM5 LCD\nThe Concept2 RowErg is a popular rower that checks all the boxes for anyone in need of a comfortable, durable, reliable machine that’s ready to withstand regular use. As the first machine to make an appearance in the CrossFit games back in 2015, it’s competition-ready and designed to take your training to the next level. While this is the go-to erg for many professional rowing teams, it can adapt to all skill levels; the expert I spoke with at USRowing had nothing but great things to say about it, recommending it for athletes at all stages in their rowing journey.\nDesigned with a heavy-duty steel and aluminum frame, the RowErg is a solid pick that can withstand heavy use. The flywheel and damper system deliver smooth resistance that’s consistent, though unlike rowers with selectable resistance levels, the RowErg’s perceived resistance is a result of how hard you row—it doesn’t have adjustable “levels” to choose from. Because it can support up to 500 pounds and is available in a 14- or 20-inch seat height, it’s a great option for big and tall users, too. The frame separates into two pieces without tools, so you can store it away and save space, and the nickel-plated chain needs to be lubricated every now and then. Otherwise, maintenance is minimal.\nWhile it’s a dependable and well-made rower with a proven track record, the RowErg isn’t packed with all that many features. The basic LCD display tracks split times, meters rowed and intervals, but it doesn’t offer guided workouts or other entertainment options. Technically, it comes with a device holder, so you can clip your smartphone in and sync it with training apps via Bluetooth to log progress and follow workouts, but that’s as far as it goes to make the experience more immersive.\nIf you’re after guided workouts, games or the ability to stream media from a large display, models like the Peloton Row , Ergatta Rower and Hydrow Pro will better meet your needs, though you’ll pay at least twice as much for that technology. But if you want a gym-quality rower for less than $1,000 that has a proven track record, this one is hard to beat.",
