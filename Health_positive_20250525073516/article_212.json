    "text": "Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. ( NYSE: NOG ) (“NOG” or the “Company”) announced today that it published its Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Report for the year ended December 31, 2024. The report is available on the Company’s website under the Sustainability section, in addition to prior year reports.\nHighlights from the 2024 Report include the publication of a formal ESG Policy, and the implementation of an ESG Risk and Control Matrix and a GHG Inventory Management Plan. We also discuss the transformation of our corporate philanthropy program to a Community Investment program that will more closely align our corporate giving with our strategic interests. The report also provides updated disclosures on our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as well as progress on our people strategy.\nNOG’s ESG disclosure framework relies on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production standard as well as the SASB Asset Management and Custody Activities standard. The Company believes that providing disclosures across these two standards best captures NOG’s business model of owning and managing non-operated minority working and mineral interests.\nABOUT NOG\nNOG is a real asset company with a primary strategy of acquiring and investing in non-operated minority working and mineral interests in the premier hydrocarbon producing basins within the contiguous United States. More information about NOG can be found at www.noginc.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250423771965/en/\nContacts Evelyn Leon Infurna\nVice President of Investor Relations\n(952) 476-9800\nir@noginc.com\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms Of Service .",
