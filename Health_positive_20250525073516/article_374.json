    "text": "Gov. Newsom announces $120 SUN Bucks cards for children this summer\nEligible children will receive $120 for groceries this summer\nEligible children will receive $120 for groceries this summer\nEligible children will receive $120 for groceries this summer\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced today that California will soon be releasing electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards for the SUN Bucks food program in summer 2025.\nCalifornia was one of the first states in the nation to launch SUN Bucks in the summer of 2024. In its first year, nearly $500 million in food purchases were made, and the families and caregivers of more than 4.3 million California children activated their SUN Bucks cards. This year, over 4 million eligible California children will automatically receive SUN Bucks EBT cards in June. Each eligible child will receive $120 on the SUN Bucks cards, which can be used to purchase groceries.\n“It’s absolutely essential that no kid in California go hungry – especially during the summer months when school meals aren’t available,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “We’re proud to administer the SUN Bucks program and lead the nation in beating childhood hunger.”\nLeading the way to fight hunger\nCalifornia was the first state to implement a statewide Universal Meals Program for schoolchildren, providing all public TK-12 students with access to two free meals per school day.\nIn September, Gov. Newsom signed legislation to increase enrollment in state food assistance programs, reduce youth consumption of processed foods, and increase access to healthy, locally grown food in all California communities.\nFirst Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom also helped develop the innovative California Farm to School initiative. The program works in tandem with universal school meals to ensure California students have access to two free school meals that are locally sourced and nutritious. California also participates in the federal SUN Bucks food program which ensures that children in families with low incomes have adequate nutrition while school is out for the summer.\nAbout the SUN Bucks program\nCongress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 in December of 2022, which created a new and permanent Summer EBT program for states to provide food benefits to families beginning in 2024.\nIn July 2023, California passed Assembly Bill 120, establishing the California Department of Social Services as the lead implementing agency to maximize Summer EBT program participation for summer 2024.\nDue to the large number of automatically enrolled children, SUN Bucks EBT card issuances will occur in two stages:\n- Stage 1: Automatically enrolled children will begin receiving their cards in early June through July 2025. Cards will be mailed in alphabetical order according to the child’s last name.\n- Stage 2: Children determined eligible after the start of Stage 1 will begin receiving their cards in September 2025 until mailings are complete.\nHow SUN Bucks works\nMost children who qualify for the following will be automatically enrolled for SUN Bucks:\n- Free or reduced-price meals through a school meal application or Universal Benefits Application.\n- Receive CalFresh, CalWORKs, and/or Medi-Cal benefits (certified at or below 185 percent of the Federal Poverty Level).\n- In foster care, experiencing homelessness or attending Head Start.\nBased on California Department of Social Services (CDSS) and California Department of Education (CDE) data, more than 4 million children will be automatically enrolled this year.\nChildren not determined to be automatically eligible may apply by submitting a school meal application or Universal Benefits Application to their school or school administrator’s office. The deadline is Sept. 1, 2025, in order to receive SUN Bucks benefits for this coming summer.\nThe cards are expected to arrive in the mail beginning in June and will continue until mailings are completed. The set amount of $120 per child is equivalent to $40 per month for June, July, and August— the three months schools are typically closed.\nRegardless of when a SUN Bucks EBT card is mailed or received, every card is loaded with the full amount for each child. Federal ruling states that funds must be used within 122 days of the funds being added to the card. Any unused funds on the card will expire after the allotted time and cannot be replaced.\nParticipation in SUN Bucks will have no bearing on eligibility for CalFresh or any other public benefit program. Children who receive SUN Bucks may also still participate in other summer meal options, such as SUN Meals.",
