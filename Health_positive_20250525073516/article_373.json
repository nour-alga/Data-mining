    "text": "TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Mental and behavioral health are getting the spotlight in East Texas. On May 6, hundreds will gather for an annual summit, complete with workshops and keynote speakers. It’s all in the interest of making connections, finding support and learning.\nIncoming CEO of the Andrews Center Becki Mangum said they had around 50 tables representing agencies and resources last year, and over 90 this year.\n“We had the idea last year, and it wound up successful beyond our wildest dreams with the number of people that attended and the feedback that we got,” Mangum said. “We had originally thought, ‘Maybe we’ll just do this one-time thing, a push,’ but so many people enjoyed it and gave us the feedback like, ‘Please, you’ve got to do it again next year.’ So, that’s where we were. It was such a great opportunity to reach out to the community and educate about mental health and provide resources.”\nShe said Texas is known to struggle when it comes to addressing mental health, with a ranking varying from 49 to 51 relative to the other states and Washington D.C., including troubling levels of suicide. And East Texas has a rate that’s even higher than the state average, Mangum said.\n“We need to raise awareness, and so this event helps people understand what to look for, what resources are out there,” she said, explaining that a study released by the state placed Texas among the top 10 in the nation in terms of number of kids, but at the very bottom in terms of mental health care.\nBecki Mangum, incoming CEO of the Andrews Center, explains how mental and behavioral health are getting the spotlight in East Texas. Even though the topic is serious, Mangum said they have worked to make the event welcoming.\n“We’ve tried to make this a fun event, so when you come in, it’s a very welcoming environment,” she said. “There’ll be musicians playing. This year we actually expanded the hours so people could spend more time exploring the resources available. Those will be set up by noon, and we will have some food trucks there, so if people want to come on their lunch hour and find out some stuff about mental health and then grab lunch, they can do that. It’s just like a fun atmosphere – it’s not a gloomy atmosphere. It’s fun. When you come, you’ll enjoy it. It’s exciting and it’s full of hope.”\nThe event will also feature two keynote speakers who will share their stories and connections with mental health and mental health advocacy.\nOn a list that includes Washington D.C., Mental Health America ranks Texas 51st in access to mental health care.\nCopyright 2025 KLTV.
