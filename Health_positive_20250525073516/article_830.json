    "text": "MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WBTW) — The South Carolina Department of Environmental Services, previously known as the Department of Health and Environmental Control, will test ocean water quality at more than 120 beaches along the coast. SCDES has monitored the state’s beaches for 25 years. Every year, from May 1 to Oct. 1, DES tests our ocean water for the Enterococcus bacteria. DES says this bacterium is not normally harmful to humans, but is a good indicator of fecal contamination in the water. The department usually sees higher levels of Enterococcus after storms, especially in areas near stormwater runoff. Depending on the amount of bacteria in a beach’s water and that beach’s popularity, DES will test the water two to four times per month. “We try to make sure that we have that information provided to everybody because we don’t want people getting sick,” DES official Lindsey Lachenmyer said. “We want to protect everybody as best as we can.” The city of Myrtle Beach says it tests its ocean water throughout the entire year. However, one visitor says she does not swim in the water in Myrtle Beach because it looks dirty. “In the Bahamas, Jamaica, it’s just clear,” Jasmine Sheppard said. “Even in Florida, you can see everything, and it’s like, ‘Oh, this feels clean.’ Then, I come here, and I’m like, ‘Oh, this is different.’” If a beach’s water has more bacteria than DES considers safe, the department issues a swimming advisory at that beach. This does not mean the beach is closed. DES just wants beachgoers to be able to decide if they feel safe swimming in the water. DES puts both long-term and short-term swimming advisory signs at each beach access. “I guess, if I did see a sign saying, ‘Hey, it’s kind of a high bacteria count,’ or something bad, then I’d be like, ‘Ehhh,'” Hunter Sheppard, another Myrtle Beach visitor, said. “But the majority of the time, I don’t really pay much mind to it. I get in no matter what.” You can go to the DES website to look for swimming advisories at your local beaches. You can also visit CheckMyBeach for advisories, rip currents, and the beach flag system. * * * Skylar Musick is a multimedia journalist at News13. Skylar is originally from Long Island, New York.
