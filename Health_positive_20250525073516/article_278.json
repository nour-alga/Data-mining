    "text": "Mr. Brent Willis reports\nVOYAGEUR LAUNCHES MARKET INTRODUCTION OF BARIUM CONTRAST PRODUCT LINE FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS\nVoyageur Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has introduced to the initial market its new line of barium contrast media products in Canada and to additional other global markets that accept Health Canada standards. Prospective customers, including diagnostic imaging centres, have begun receiving product samples for evaluation as part of a targeted test marketing phase. This is a critical step before any orders can be placed.\nThe company's barium contrast line was recently evaluated in a performance study conducted at Canada diagnostic centres in Calgary with 24 subjects. The study assessed image quality and product behaviour under standard clinical protocols in comparison with competing product equivalents. The radiologist leading the study, Dr. Robert Davies, and consulting radiologist Dr. Dan Johnson, both provided positive feedback, particularly for Voyageur's high-density barium suspensions used in double contrast upper gastrointestinal tract and small bowel examinations. From a product performance perspective, this positive feedback puts Voyageur's products on par with existing products on the market.\nVoyageur believes it is now a player in the contrast media market, establishing its initial supply chain, which can be replicated in other markets and improved through the development of the Frances Creek project. There are very few players in this growing and dynamic industry, and Voyageur officially joins them. Voyageur firmly believes it has a competitive product suite to go head to head with its international counterparts.\nVoyageur will be focusing some of its efforts on sales and marketing in jurisdictions where it is able. In addition, as mentioned in the press release dated Feb. 5, 2025, Voyageur will advance trials of its products using Frances Creek barium sulphate against competing products on the market with the assistance of Alberta Innovates. Lastly, Voyageur will initiate phase 2 testing to support Food and Drug Administration licensing under the 505(2)(b) pathway. The next phase will generate clinical and operational data focused on key performance indicators, including safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, regulatory compliance and market readiness.\nBrent Willis, president, chief executive officer and director, stated: \"This milestone marks a transformative moment for Voyageur Pharmaceuticals as we begin the market introduction of our innovative barium contrast product line in Canada. It represents a critical first step in our broader commercialization strategy and reinforces our commitment to vertical integration and supply chain security. As we move forward with plans to expand globally, this launch highlights the growth potential of our business and our dedication to delivering long-term value and innovation to patients, partners and shareholders alike.\"\nVoyageur's initial product portfolio includes:\nSmoothX (2 per cent w/v): for CT imaging of the gastrointestinal tract; preferred taste noted in testing; SmoothHD 105 per cent: high-density suspension for upper GI and double contrast studies; excellent clarity and mucosal detail; SmoothLD (60 per cent w/v): low-density suspension for single contrast imaging of the esophagus, stomach and small bowel; VisionHD (98 per cent w/w): powdered high-density suspension for double-contrast radiographic studies of the GI tract; VisionLD (96 per cent w/w): powdered low-density suspension for single contrast studies.\nAdditionally, Voyageur is preparing to introduce V-gas effervescent granules, a companion product used in double contrast studies and for managing digestive discomfort. This product is currently pending Health Canada licensing.\nA new entry in a critical market\nBarium contrast media plays an essential role in gastrointestinal imaging, offering a reliable, radiopaque medium with favourable safety and cost profiles compared with iodinated agents. Voyageur's innovative formulations are designed to meet the needs of both adult and pediatric patients in a range of imaging contexts.\nAmidst global supply chain disruptions and increased imaging demand, Voyageur's vertical integration model, centred around the Frances Creek barium project, positions the company to deliver stable, domestic supply to North American markets. The global contrast media market was valued at $6.28-billion (U.S.) in 2023, with barium-based products comprising approximately 10 per cent of that total and projected to grow steadily through 2030.\nPreparing for commercial expansion with regulatory groundwork laid and clinical validation achieved, Voyageur is preparing for broader commercialization. As part of this next phase, the company is:\nFinalizing product monographs, instructions for use and educational materials; Establishing postmarket surveillance and product support infrastructure; Engaging radiology clinics across Canada for sample-based evaluations.\nAbout Frances Creek pharmaceutical project\nThe Voyageur Frances Creek project is a pivotal initiative by Voyageur, centred on a 100-per-cent-owned barium sulphate (barite) quarry located in British Columbia, Canada. This project is a cornerstone of Voyageur's strategy to vertically integrate the production of high-quality barium contrast agents for radiology, addressing global supply chain vulnerabilities and enhancing imaging quality.\nResource and scale: The project boasts a 120,000-tonne resource of USP-grade (United States Pharmacopeia) barium sulphate, independently valued at $344-million under National Instrument 43-101 standards.\nCost advantage: Production costs at Frances Creek are significantly lower than synthetic alternatives, at $650 per tonne compared with $7,000 to $24,000 per tonne for synthetic barium sulphate. This cost-efficiency enables Voyageur to achieve gross margins exceeding 70 per cent, providing a competitive edge in the $600-million barium contrast market.\nStrategic importance: The project disrupts the current market monopoly which has shifted to synthetic barium due to depleted natural sources. By reclaiming access to high-quality natural barium, Voyageur can leverage its cost and quality advantages to capture market share.\nSupply chain security: Frances Creek ensures a secure, domestic-controlled supply of pharmaceutical-grade barium sulphate, reducing reliance on imports and mitigating shortages that have impacted North American markets.\nSustainability: The project aligns with Voyageur's environmental goals, incorporating sustainable mining practices and plans for carbon-neutral operations.\nIn summary, the Frances Creek project is a high-value, strategically significant asset that empowers Voyageur to disrupt the barium contrast market, enhance diagnostic imaging and drive long-term growth while addressing critical supply chain and quality challenges in radiology.\nAbout Voyageur Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nVoyageur, a Canadian public company trading under the symbol VM on the exchange, is in development of barium and iodine active pharmaceutical ingredients that offer high performance and cost-effective imaging contrast agents. With a strategic focus on vertically integrating the barium and iodine contrast markets, Voyageur aims to become a key player by producing its own barium and iodine. In addition, Voyageur is pursuing the development of new endo fullerene drugs.\nVoyageur's business plan is set to generate cash flow by partnering with established third party good manufacturing practice pharmaceutical manufacturers in Canada thereby ensuring the validation of its products by regulatory agencies worldwide. As Voyageur solidifies its presence in the market, it plans to transition into a high-margin domestic manufacturer of radiology drugs.\nVoyageur is committed to sustainability and environmental stewardship. Voyageur envisions a future where reducing carbon emissions is the norm, and, to achieve this, it intends to build state-of-the-art carbon-capture infrastructure utilizing the Rain Cage Eden system. By investing in carbon-capture energy sources and sustainable manufacturing practices, Voyageur aims to generate revenue from carbon-captured advanced carbon production. Voyageur believes its unwavering commitment to the environment sets it apart as a pioneer in the industry.\nAt the core of its operations, Voyageur owns a 100-per-cent interest in the Frances Creek barium sulphate (barite) project. Currently, the world's pharmaceutical barium sulphate is almost entirely synthetically produced resulting in a less effective imaging quality product. Voyageur's Frances Creek resource boasts a rare and exceptional-grade mineral suitable for the pharmaceutical marketplace that Voyageur believes will replace the current synthetic products with higher-quality imaging products.\nVoyageur's ambitious vision is to become the first vertically integrated company in the radiology contrast media drug market. By controlling all primary input costs, from the sourcing of raw materials to final production, Voyageur believes it can ensure quality and cost-efficiency. With its approach, it embodies the motto of from the earth to the bottle, highlighting Voyageur's commitment to responsible sourcing and manufacturing practices.\nWe seek Safe Harbor.\n© 2025 Canjex Publishing Ltd.
