Launches Remineralizing Gum to Support Oral Health 04-23-2025 11:46 PM CET | Health & Medicine\nPress release from: Getnews / PR Agency: Brand Featured\nCalifornia, United States - April 23, 2025 - Larine Co., a California-based company dedicated to practical dental care innovations, has announced the release of its latest product-LarineCo Trademark Remineralizing Gum. Designed to promote oral health through scientifically supported ingredients, the gum offers a convenient solution for individuals seeking to enhance their dental care habits beyond conventional methods.\nImage: https://www.globalnewslines.com/uploads/2025/04/46615e93a72fd55f7618f50c9ce4c5a8.jpg\nA Modern Take on Dental Care\nFormulated with xylitol and hydroxyapatite, two ingredients backed by dental research, LarineCo Trademark Remineralizing Gum is crafted to support the natural process of remineralization-a key mechanism in maintaining tooth enamel strength. The gum provides an accessible alternative for users aiming to integrate more oral health support into their daily routines.\nEach pack contains 18 pieces and comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. Since its recent market debut, the company reports over 320,000 units sold in five countries, generating an estimated $5 million in total sales.\nScience-Driven Formulation\nXylitol, a plant-derived sweetener, has been shown to help reduce harmful oral bacteria that contribute to cavities. Hydroxyapatite, a calcium-based mineral naturally present in tooth enamel, has gained attention for its role in promoting enamel repair by binding to and reinforcing the tooth surface.\n\"These ingredients were selected based on their established benefits in oral health science,\" said the company's spokesperson Matthew DeWitte. \"We wanted to create a product that's both effective and easy to incorporate into everyday life.\"\nSupporting Enamel and Gum Health\nIn addition to remineralization, the gum formulation also targets other key areas of oral wellness. Ingredients such as mastic, myrrh, and acacia have been included for their potential to support gum health and freshen breath naturally. The product is especially useful in addressing oral pH balance, helping to shift the mouth to a more alkaline state that favors enamel maintenance.\nNot a Replacement-A Complement\nLarine Co. emphasizes that LarineCo Trademark Remineralizing Gum is intended as a complementary tool and not a replacement for brushing or flossing. It is ideal for individuals looking for an additional layer of dental care in settings where traditional oral hygiene routines may be less accessible.\nTo learn more about LarineCo Trademark Remineralizing Gum and explore its full ingredient profile, visit https://buylarine.com [ https://buylarine.com/ ].\nAbout Larine Co.\nLarine Co. is committed to developing oral health products that merge scientific research with everyday functionality. Based in California, the company focuses on accessible solutions designed to empower individuals in maintaining lifelong dental wellness.\nImage: https://www.globalnewslines.com/uploads/2025/04/351fb50cbc9bb784c5ddff04aad15a95.jpg\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Larine Co.\nContact Person: Matthew DeWitte\nEmail: Send Email [ http://www.universalpressrelease.com/?pr=larine-co-launches-remineralizing-gum-to-support-oral-health ]\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://buylarine.com/\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
