    "text": "Actress Kathryn Morris remembers the first time her twin sons—Rocco and Jameson, now 11—spotted their mother on the small screen in her iconic role as Detective Lilly Rush in the hit CBS series Cold Case. Morris’ beloved character—which she played 2003 to 2010—was a Philadelphia homicide detective who investigated murders that had gone unsolved for often decades, and struck her sons as more intense than the fun-loving mom they knew.\n“You’re very serious, Mom! You’re the boss!” Rocco said as he watched the pilot episode. Morris’ life changed dramatically when she became a mother to the twins in 2013, and changed again when both boys were diagnosed with autism.\nWhile this presented challenges, Morris says the story of autism is a beautiful one—and her life with the boys is an incredible life. “I really hate it when there are all these articles about the struggles and sadness of having children with autism,” Morris says. “It’s always very depressing and kind of ableist, and it’s not celebrating neurodiversity. It’s really so much bigger than that.\n “I wasn’t really on the mom train; I wasn’t really expecting I was going to be a mother, and I never knew it was going to be this challenging—this great adventure,” Morris continues. “I didn’t know what to expect. And this has been the most enriching, powerful, life-changing, exciting experience of our lives. We are having the best time!”\nWanting to help people with autism and their families, Morris launched The Savants , a support community and lifestyle brand. The website offers stories about people on the autism spectrum and a blog. The Instagram page and YouTube channel offer informative and fun videos, and Morris is expanding the YouTube offerings with more entertainment and education, and videos with guest speakers both on and off the autism spectrum.\n“It’s a one-stop place where you can go,” Morris says. “I just want to have a place that really serves the whole family and community unit. We’re really a portal for comfort, community, and connection.”\nHere, Morris shares her advice for life, health and happiness with FIRST for Women .\nKathryn Morris, 2019 Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic/Getty Images FIRST for Women (FFW) : What advice would you give to parents with children who have autism? Kathryn Morris: I would say, if you’re new to the process of early diagnosis and the waiting period, keep your circle small—just your ride-or-die friends. You can say, “Hey, I’ve got a lot going on right now. I think I’m going to cancel everything for the year until I figure out what’s going on with me and my child.” Put a loving, protective wall around yourself. A lot of people will try to bombard you with links and books to “fix” autism.\nThe Savants is really about healing the unit. Keep your ride-or-die friends close, and say, “I’m going to lean into my community, the ones who are going through what I’m going through, and keep my circle insulated with people who’ve been there before.” It’s an act of self-care.\nFFW : What keeps you energized/inspired/motivated on your busiest days? KM: Definitely my children. Slowing down, taking a breath, and watching how they enjoy the simple joys—the little things, like discovering something new. With time being so limited and things so hectic, I’ve had to slow down because health has been such a big focus in our household. I really value the moments: having a meal, having a conversation.\nFFW : What are three actionable ways you relieve stress? KM: First, notice your breath. Find space in the moment. Pay attention to the pattern and allow yourself to process what’s happening in your body. Don’t hold it in—let it flow.\nSecond, take action. Walk, sip water, step outside—whatever helps you reset. It starts with the breath, but you move forward by moving.\nThird, let it go. It’s a fresh start, a do-over. Every moment is a chance to begin again.\nKathryn Morris, 2017 Michael Tran/FilmMagic/Getty Images FFW : Where do you get your inner strength? KM: My inner strength comes from my children and the core values I was raised with—kindness, integrity, and the golden rule. I’m especially inspired by the clarity and moral compass of my neurodiverse children. It’s as if they’re tuned into something higher, and we have so much to learn from that. I’m grounded by the wisdom of our elders, especially grandparents, and the lessons they pass down. I’m an optimistic, hopeful person. I believe in people and in the goodness of others. And I do have faith. I live in hope.\nFFW : Do you have any beauty hacks? KM: I embraced paleo living. I kind of stripped away a lot of things. I like health store beauty products and Korean skin care. For me, at this point, less is more. I have a very clean liver. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I’ve always had the long game in mind. My mom would tell me, ‘Just put Vaseline all over your face.’ Mom is very natural; she applies a little mascara, a little lipstick. She’s a natural beauty.\nFFW : What special projects are you working on? KM: Of course, I’m always an actor, but I pulled back to focus on my kids. Now, I feel so invigorated after launching The Savants . I’m excited that it’s really stepping into another level. I’d love to do a comedy and another powerhouse role. I’m just excited about the future—it feels like a new chapter. It’s been the most intense decade ever, a decade I didn’t expect.\nIf you’re struggling with something, don’t be sad. Be encouraged, because on the other side, it’s so bright, and it brings perspective. My children have taught me so much about life. The conversations we have are unlike anything I’ve ever had with anyone, and I am forever changed because of them. My greatest role has been the transformation into mother, person, and actress. There are layers I never would have imagined.\nFFW : Was Detective Lilly Rush on Cold Case your favorite role? How are you like her and unlike her? KM: I would say she’s one of my favorites. I spent so much time with her, so she felt like family. I would probably say she’s one of my favorites, if not the favorite. I spent so much time with her, and there are pieces of her that we didn’t even cover. I spent so much time doing Cold Case , and Lilly is so close to the heart.\nKathryn Morris, 2017 Roy Rochlin/Getty Images FFW : Many of our readers deal with pain. Do you have any secrets to easing aches? KM: Magnesium creams that you can put on feet, CBD creams, and turmeric creams you can get at a health food store. Those are amazing!\nFFW : What is the wisest advice you’ve ever gotten? KM: ‘Become so talented that they can’t afford not to hire you.’ Larry Moss, my acting coach.\nFFW : What advice would you give them for feeling confident just as they are? KM: If the gym doesn’t make you happy, do something else. Don’t chase trends—do what fills your soul. Dance, move, laugh, run—whatever makes you feel alive, especially with the people you love. That’s where real confidence comes from. If you’ve raised four kids, there’s a swagger in that. If you’ve worked for three decades, take pride in what you’ve learned. Your beauty is in your story, your joy, and your laughter. Most people are drawn to you because of your energy, not a superficial exterior. A healthy body is a miracle. Just watch your kids—they know how to live. And don’t save your nice clothes. Wear them now. You’d be surprised how transformative that simple act can be. You are the special occasion—every day.\nFFW : Do you have any tips or tricks for menopause symptoms or embracing your age? KM: Absolutely. First—more protein, more hydration, magnesium, and collagen. Those basics can be game-changers. Also, work with a great functional medicine doctor for natural support. Ask for specialized testing, including hormone panels and thyroid workups, so you know exactly what your body needs. There are so many options now to support this phase of life in a personalized, empowered way. And strength training—don’t sleep on it. This is your power chapter, Foxy, not the decline. You’ve earned every inch of wisdom and energy you carry. Own it.\nFFW : What brings you the most joy in life? KM: Nothing brings me more joy than watching my autistic children live their best lives—fully themselves, fully included, and full of joy. Seeing my twins experience pure happiness, dancing like no one’s watching, doing the things we were once told might never be possible—that’s everything. That kind of joy, that kind of freedom, is unmatched. Nothing else in life compares.",
