    "text": "Do you remember Cam Reddish’s heartfelt tribute to his Blue Devils teammates’ mother? Before any NBA coach, Debbie Jones stood by Tre Jones as his coach. While Reddish was drafted in 2019, Jones still had another year at Duke. He made a heart touching tribute to Debbie, who was battling breast cancer. Tre added “Momma Jones” with a pink ribbon on the right side of his suit lining. During tough times like these, it’s the love and support of friends that matter most. La La Anthony and Gabrielle Union were quick to send heartfelt warmth to the Grammy-winning artist’s mother.\nBoth Gabrielle Union and La La Anthony are proud authors. La La Anthony penned her first book, The Love Playbook: Rules for Love, Sex, and Happiness which was released in 2014, chronicling her marriage, friendships, and more. The Bring It On actress, Union, has shared raw confessions and tough experiences in her three books. Another supermom who has raised and supported her star kids, Beyoncé and Solange Knowles has just released her book.\nAffectionately known by many as Momma Tina, Knowles has decided to open up about her personal life and stories in her new memoir, “Matriarch,” where she discusses her battle with breast cancer. She was diagnosed at stage 1 in July 2024. She just shared a post on IG to announce the launch of the book.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\n“I come from a long line of storytellers – strong, powerful women who have shaped who I am today. My family, especially the women, have always been my inspiration, teaching me to embrace my power and pass it down to the next generation,” the caption read. Both Anthony and Union shared clips on their IG stories to express their love and support. “Congratulations, @mstinaknowles. Thank you for sharing your soul with us,” Union wrote.\n“Congratulations, Momma T., @mstinaknowles on your MATRIARCH book release today!!!! Love you always!!!! Can’t wait to read this!!!” Anthony captioned her story. The two appreciated her courage to open up about personal struggles. “Matriarch” not only shares Knowles’ battles but also gives a glimpse into her personal life and experiences. Oprah Winfrey announced that this is the latest selection for her renowned Oprah’s Book Club.\nView this post on Instagram\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nUnion’s husband, the Miami Heat Dwyane Wade, has also recently opened up about his cancer diagnosis.\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs sharing personal struggles publicly a sign of strength or vulnerability in today's world?\nHave an interesting take?\nDwyane Wade spoke about his kidney cancer diagnosis\nWade, on his podcast “The Why With Dwyane Wade,” revealed that he had just wanted a minor checkup. He had a weaker urine stream and slight stomach discomfort. While athletes are used to routine checkups, they often skip them after retirement.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nSince his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer, he wanted to get a checkup just to be sure. He decided to undergo a full-body exam. During the checkup, the doctors noticed a questionable mass on his kidney. He was nervous when the doctor suggested that surgery was the only way to determine if it was cancerous.\nWade had undergone surgeries before, but this was different. After much thought, he agreed and chose to have surgery, during which 40 percent of his kidney was removed. This was way back in 2023. It took Wade a long time to open up about it. It was a tough experience for both Wade and his family. “(Don’t) be afraid to open up and tell someone what you’re feeling. … I’m here and cancer-free because I let the ones that love me love me,” the Miami Heat legend told USA Today. By doing so, Wade has empowered others to do the same.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Is sharing personal struggles publicly a sign of strength or vulnerability in today's world?\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
