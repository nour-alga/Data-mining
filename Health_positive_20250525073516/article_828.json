    "text": "Centennial Area Health Education Center will host “AHEC of a Party” from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Friday at the LINC Library, 501 8th Ave., Greeley.\nThe event will showcase collaborative efforts to improve health outcomes in northeastern Colorado through an interactive mental health education exhibit, a virtual dementia tour, Anatomy in Clay and health care career exploration programs, according to a Centennial Area Health Education Center news release.\nBe Mindful, It Matters, which is available at the library through May 15, will offer interactive mental health education. The exibit will feature two mental health trainings conducted by North Range Behavioral Health: Mental Health 101 and Self Care for the Real World. Representatives from 988 Colorado will also be on-site.\nThe educational exhibit, made possible by the Weld Trust, formed from a partnership between the University of Northern Colorado and Aims Community College students, nonprofit partners and community members.\nArea Health Education Centers have existed since 1977, working behind the scenes to support the health care workforce and provide health education to communities, according to Melissa Jensen, executive director of the Centennial Area Health Education Center. But the center is still unknown to many.\n“We need to change that so more organizations want to collaborate with us to expand our reach,” Jensen said.\nAlthough based in Greeley, Centennial Area Health Education Center serves 12 counties in northeastern Colorado.
