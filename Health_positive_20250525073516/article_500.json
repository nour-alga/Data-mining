    "text": "Teddi Mellencamp has shared a hopeful update in her cancer journey after revealing earlier this year that melanoma had spread to her lungs and brain.\nIn a smile-filled video shared to Instagram April 23, the 43-year-old reality star shared that her brain tumors have \"significantly shrunk\" — a milestone she says is a positive sign that treatment is working.\n\"Exciting news, everyone,\" the television personality said in the video. \"Honestly, the crying was already done, but I just finished with all of my scans, and my tumors have significantly shrunk, which doctors believe means that this all will work, and that I will be back to myself and feeling good.\"\nIn the caption of her post, Mellencamp added more details about her progress.\n“One update I couldn’t wait to share! All tumors stage 4 (metastasized melanoma in my brain and lungs) shrunk or disappeared so I have 6ish more weeks of immunotherapy and doctors believe I will be healed if everything stays on course,\" she wrote. \"Thank you to everyone who has sent their love, prayers, and positivity.”\nMellencamp, who has been transparent about her diagnosis and cancer treatment since 2022, shared that she has two more rounds of immunotherapy to go.\n\"I’m going to keep a positive outlook, because that’s the way my doctor just spoke to me,\" she said. \"He’s like, 'You did this, you got this.'\"\nMellencamp’s followers were quick to celebrate her post, which received more than 70,000 likes and 6,000 comments within three hours of being shared on the platform.\n“I can’t stop crying tears of joy … I love you,” Tamra Judge, who also appears in the \"Real Housewives\" franchise, wrote.\n\"This is incredible news I’m so happy!!\" Marysol Patton, of \"Real Housewives of Miami\" responded. \"It was my therapeutic playlist !!!\"\n\"What a wonderful report Teddi! This truly made my day I think of you all the time,\" another fan wrote.\nMellencamp was originally diagnosed with Stage 2 melanoma in October 2022, and she underwent several surgeries for the skin cancer.\nEarlier this year, Mellencamp said doctors discovered several tumors in her brain and lung, which she confirmed were metastases of melanoma and would be treated with surgery and immunotherapy.",
