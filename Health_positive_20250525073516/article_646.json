'One-of-a-kind' girl born with heart outside chest has pioneering surgery\n23 hours ago Share Save Sarah Hawley BBC News, East Midlands Share Save\nSupplied Vanellope Hope Wilkins, now aged seven, was born with her heart outside of her body\nVanellope Hope Wilkins made medical history when she was born with her heart outside of her body in 2017. Described by experts as \"one of a kind\", Vanellope had three operations to place her heart back in her chest due to an extremely rare condition called ectopia cordis. The hospital where she was born - Glenfield Hospital in Leicester - says it knows of no other case in the UK where the baby has survived. Now seven years old, Vanellope has undergone groundbreaking surgery to reconstruct a protective cage around her heart - using her ribs.\nThe BBC was given exclusive access into theatre, when the operation took place at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, based at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, last Wednesday. Warning: This story contains an image of surgery\nGlenfield Hospital A team of around 50 staff worked to bring Vanellope into the world, on 22 November 2017\nIt's early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place. Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin. Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest. Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope's birth on 22 November. Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before. \"I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,\" he says. \"But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life.\" He remembers how \"everything was unknown\" when Vanellope was born,…\nSarah Hawley",
