    "text": "FujiFilm lands $3B manufacturing deal with Regeneron in Holly Springs\nContract manufacturer FujiFilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, which has been expanding its footprint in Holly Springs, has signed a $3 billion agreement to make treatments for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.\nUnder the agreement, announced Tuesday, FujiFilm Diosynth would produce Regeneron’s biologic medicines over 10 years at its growing biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in the western Wake County town. The facility is scheduled to begin operations later this year.\n“We are honored that Regeneron has the trust and confidence in our team’s ability to help deliver capacity faster, ensuring continuity of supply for patients in need,” Lars Petersen, the chief executive of FujiFilm Diosynth, said in a statement.\nWestchester, New York-based Regeneron makes drugs that treat asthma, high cholesterol, arthritis and vision loss, among other conditions. Daniel Van Plew, Regeneron’s executive vice president of industrial operations and product supply said the company is already working to bring capacity online in Holly Springs.\nFujifilm Diosynth announced plans a year ago to add 680 high-paying jobs at its Holly Springs campus — part of a $1.2 billion expansion of what is expected to be one of the biggest biomanufacturing facilities of its kind in North America. In total, the company expects to invest $3.2 billion and hire up to 1,400 people at the campus by 2031. The company said 500 of those jobs have already been created.\n•Credits\nJack Hagel\nCopyright 2025 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved.
