    "text": "No green thumb? Tips for aspiring gardeners this Spring\nJACKSON, Tenn. — Spring is officially here and many people may want to get out to the garden.\nNot everyone has the resources for a giant garden or greenhouse in their backyard. Some people live in apartments, or have very small yards. That should not stop you from gardening, as there are other ways you can get involved.\n“You can garden in your flowerbed, you can garden in buckets, you can build a raised bed, some people even garden in bails of wheat straw,” said Ginger Kemp, owner of\nR & J Feed Supply. “It’s just open ended possibilities that you can garden without having a large garden that you have to till up and things like that.”\nIf you have never done any gardening before, Kemp gives us some great tips and advice to make sure we start off right.\n“You want a plant that has a really sturdy, like a stalk on it,” Kemp said. “So it is really easy for you to plant without having to break it off and things like that. When you put it in your soil, you want to plant it deep so you’ll have a good root system established.”\nThis can help make sure it does not get damaged by the wind. Kemp says it is also important to have good quality soil so your plants can flourish.\nKemp also says that if you have thought about gardening, you should simply give it a shot.\n“The big thing is don’t be scared to try. If you don’t try, then you don’t succeed or fail. That is one of my personal things. When I go home at night I love to work in the yard or work in the garden,” said Kemp.\nShe also says that it is a great tool for children, learning how to take care of a plant and watching it grow.\nIf you want to learn more, you can contact your local Ag center to ask any questions that you may have.\nFor more local news,\nclick here.",
