    "text": "Eric Prindle saved JJ the kitten, and helped him seek treatment for his eye injuries, severe facial burns, burnt whiskers and burnt ears\nBy Charna Flam Charna Flam Charna Flam is a writer-reporter at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared on Variety, The New York Post, and The Wrap. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 23, 2025 06:09PM EDT 5 Comments Eric Prindle and JJ the kitten. Photo: Fox 9/Youtube\nA Minnesota first responder not only saved one kitten's life, but also gave it a forever home.\nIn February, Coon Rapids Community Service Officer Eric Prindle responded to a grass fire that started at a homeless encampment in Coon Rapids, Minn. Upon arrival, a small injured kitten, who belonged to one of the people at the encampment, was found in the field.\n\"I went and looked at it and realized we need to get this thing care right away,\" Prindle told FOX9 in an interview published on Monday, April 21.\nHe then took the cat, named JJ, to the Animal Humane Society in Coon Rapids to ensure he would survive his eye injuries and severe facial burns. JJ's whiskers and a portion of his ears were burnt off.\nPrindle confessed that once he was driving to the Animal Humane Society, he thought to himself, “ ‘Please don’t be dead in my backseat,’ ” he told FOX9 , adding, “And then I saw he was alive.”\nTruck Driver and Police Officer Stop Traffic on Busy Florida Highway to Rescue Tiny Kitten \"It was one of those situations where I was very concerned he wasn’t going to make it,\" Animal Humane Society veterinarian Dr. Kate Farmer said. \"He was kind of a long shot, but we wanted to give him a chance.”\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThroughout JJ’s recovery, Prindle continued to visit the kitten, because “he just touched me,\" Prindle said.\nMichigan Firefighters Help Rescue Curious Kitten Stuck in Car Muffler Once JJ grew stronger, Prindle and his wife adopted the kitten and brought him into his new forever home, where “he’s adjusting real good,\" Prindle said.\n\"Watching his progress through the whole thing was just amazing,\" Prindle told FOX9.\nJJ still needs ointment around his scars, but his whiskers are beginning to grow back, and he’s beginning to live life as a normal cat — and get along well with Prindle’s dog, Twinkie.\n\"It was amazing actually to see his remarkable capacity to heal and his emotional resilience to get through something that must have been awful,\" Farmer said.\nClose Leave a Comment",
