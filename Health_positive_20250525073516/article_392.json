    "text": "Riddle Hospital President Shelly Buck spoke of how her hospital is responding to Crozer Health system closure and that Main Line Health doors are open for community members impacted by these changes.\n“Main Line Health has been preparing to take on additional volume since Crozer closed their emergency departments in 2022,” she said of the closure of Delaware County Memorial Hospital .\nOther nearby Main Line Health hospitals include Lankenau and Bryn Mawr.\nBuck said Main Line facilities have been ramping up and preparing even more with surge spaces and plans for staffing.\n“We’re ready to help and do our part … to maintain access to the community and provide the services that they need,” she said.\nThe entrance to Riddle Hospital Emergency Department. It is being expanded to accommodate more incoming patients, the hospital president says. (PETE BANNAN – DAILY TIMES) Her reassurances come on the heels of a Texas bankruptcy judge supporting the expedited closure of Crozer-Chester Medical Center and Taylor Hospital, the last two Crozer Health hospitals, earlier this week .\nBuck said four units were maintained in East Tower solely to be ready to provide care to more patients and that the emergency department is being expanded to bring people in faster.\nIn addition, a CT scanner is being added to help decrease the amount of time it takes to get a scan.\nThe Crozer workers She said conversations have been ongoing with ob/gyn staff, including physicians and midwives, and a career fair was held Monday as Crozer Health ob/gyn staff have been transitioning .\n“We were able to talk with them about the hospital, operating room and labor and delivery unit and NICU (neonatal intensive care unit),” Buck said.\nA heartwarming moment is when some former Crozer Health staff who already came to Riddle saw former colleagues at the fair.\n“It was nice for them to see familiar faces,” Buck said. “I was all smiles when I saw some of the nurses run up and hug the doctors.”\nShe said more career fairs will be coming as early as next week.\nRiddle Hospital. Riddle and other Main Line Health facilities have openings that Crozer personnel are welcome to apply for, says Riddle President Shelly Buck. (KATHLEEN E. CAREY – DAILY TIMES) “We are hosting employment fairs for the staff,” Buck said. “We’re preparing for fairs. We have open positions in all of our campuses. Where someone sees an opportunity that’s good for them, we would love to speak with them.”\nShe explained how the entire situation has been one of delicate balance.\n“No one plans a year in a advance or two years in advance for something like this to happen,” Buck said. “No one wants to see a health system close their doors.”\nThat said, the anticipated hospital closures will bring more patients to Riddle and other surrounding hospitals.\nBuck said Main Line Health, as well as other health care systems in the region have been working with the Delaware County Department of Health and other county officials to address the needs of this time.\n“It really is a regional approach,” she said. “We’re doing the best that we can.”\nBuck also had a few words to the community, both employees and patients at Crozer Health.\n“We are saddened by these events and the outcome,” Buck said. “We have been advocating and hoping that it would be different. However, now that we are at this point, all are welcome.”\nHaving served as a registered nurse herself, she had special words for the Crozer health staff.\n“I want to thank all of the nurse and ancillary teams and the physicians that have stayed there this long and have committed to the community their knowledge and their time,” Buck said. “This was not an easy thing to do. They should all be commended for it. They truly are heroes.”\nShe also offered some words to Crozer Health patients, dealing with the uncertainty of change right now.\n“There are health care systems with their doors open ready to accept you and continue to provide your care,” she said.\nBuck also had an ask of staff looking for work.\n“We know that our physicians have a choice,” Buck said. “Consider us as one option.”\nChamber of commerce Relatedly, the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce said it was ready to help in whatever way it could.\n“The Delaware County Chamber of Commerce is greatly disappointed in the news of Crozer Health’s closing,” a chamber statement said. “As the only Chamber of Commerce and the largest business advocacy organization in the county, we recognize the profound impact this closure will have — not only on our healthcare system, but also on our local businesses, economy and the lives of countless residents and healthcare workers.\n“We are deeply appreciative of the concerted efforts made by Governor Josh Shapiro, our local state officials, Delaware County Council, and especially The Foundation for Delaware County,” the chamber noted. “The Foundation’s commitment to safeguarding access to healthcare — demonstrated through their $20 million emergency investment and tireless advocacy — has been nothing short of extraordinary.”\nChamber officials recognized the position Crozer has had.\n“For decades, Crozer has played a vital role in our community, serving as one of Delaware County’s primary healthcare providers and a cornerstone of our local economy,” the chamber said. “The health system has cared for countless businesses and residents, provided critical medical services, and employed dedicated healthcare professionals who have made a lasting impact on the well-being of our county. For those affected by this closure, please know that our Chamber is here to support you.”",
