    "text": "Heart of Alabama Food Bank announces 3 new programs to help thousands of residents\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - The Heart of Alabama Food Bank announced Wednesday that it’s started three new programs to help thousands of people across the state.\nMichael Coleman, the CEO of the food bank, says they are focusing on rural counties since they have the fewest resources.\nThe programs introduced include:\nFood as Medicine - This program provides medically tailored meals, produce, and other resources to help sick individuals access and afford healthy food.\nHeroes Harvest - This program gives meals to active-duty military families. They will get two food deliveries a month for up to six months.\nMobile Market - This program will allow the food bank to carry up to 6,000 pounds of fresh produce, dairy, and other refrigerated foods. It will go to set locations in rural areas that don’t have grocery store access.\nThe Heart of Alabama Food Bank is also working with the Montgomery Cancer Center, Jackson Hospital, and the Kidney Foundation.\nThey are already receiving referrals for cancer patients who are food insecure, and food bank officials say they are delivering 40 pounds of fresh produce, protein, and shelf stable food to their doorsteps.\nThe Heart of Alabama Food Bank serves 35 of Alabama’s 67 counties.\nNot reading this story on the WSFA News App?
