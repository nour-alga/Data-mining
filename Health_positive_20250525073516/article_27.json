    "text": "Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (VKTX, Financial) has carried forward its robust performance from 2024 into the first quarter of 2025, as the company continues to make significant strides in its clinical trials. The pharmaceutical firm is preparing to initiate Phase 3 trials for VK2735's subcutaneous formulation, with plans to commence these trials before the quarter concludes.\nEarlier this quarter, Viking not only launched the Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing trial for the tablet form of VK2735 but also swiftly completed the trial's participant enrollment. This rapid enrollment highlights the ongoing interest and support for VK2735 from both clinical investigators and participants. Results from this study are anticipated in the latter half of the year.\nIn addition to advancing its clinical pipeline, Viking has entered into an extensive manufacturing agreement with CordenPharma. This deal ensures a steady supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and provides vital fill and finish capabilities for both injectable and oral formulations of VK2735, paving the way for future commercialization efforts.\nLooking at its pipeline, Viking is progressing its novel amylin agonist program and is on track to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application by the end of the year. Furthermore, the company ended the first quarter with a robust balance sheet, maintaining over $850 million in cash, which bolsters its capacity to continue advancing its development programs.\nWall Street Analysts Forecast\nBased on the one-year price targets offered by 15 analysts, the average target price for Viking Therapeutics Inc (VKTX, Financial) is $93.13 with a high estimate of $125.00 and a low estimate of $30.00.
