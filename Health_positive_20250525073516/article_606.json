    "text": "Amedisys Shares Soar 3.21% on Strong Q1 Earnings\nAmedisys (AMED) shares surged 3.21% intraday, reaching their highest level since November 2024, marking a third consecutive day of gains with a total increase of 2.04% over the past three days.\nAmedisys reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2025, posting a profit of $61 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.84. This performance indicates a profitable quarter, with earnings increasing compared to the same period last year and surpassing Wall Street estimates.\nDespite the strong EPS performance, the company's revenue of $594.8 million slightly missed estimates, presenting a mixed financial outcome for the period. This discrepancy between earnings and revenue may have contributed to the stock's recent volatility.\nOn April 17, 2025, [amedisys] extended its credit facility amid merger discussions. This move could impact the company's financial flexibility and strategic opportunities, potentially influencing investor sentiment and stock price movements.",
