    "text": "GULF WEEKLY -\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by repetitive, restricted, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities, as well as difficulties in social interaction and communication. This year's theme 'Advancing Neurodiversity and the UN Sustainable Development Goals' highlights the intersection between neurodiversity and global sustainability efforts.\nDr Mariam Alammadi, a licensed psychologist who has been working in mental health for the last 14 years and founder of award-winning The Child and Family Foundation Centre, shares her insights on how being a caregiver for autistic individuals affects mental health.\n1. What are some of the most common mental health challenges caregivers of autistic individuals experience, particularly in the early stages after a diagnosis?\nRight after a diagnosis, many caregivers feel overwhelmed. It’s common to feel sadness, fear, guilt, or confusion.\nSome might blame themselves or believe things that aren’t true - for example, the false idea that vaccines may cause autism or I have had patients tell me their child is regressing due to a fall or bumping their head.\nCaregivers may also feel stressed trying to understand what autism means for their child’s future and how to get the right support.\nIt is important for them to understand high functioning autism and low functioning autism.\nCaring for an autistic person can be a lifelong responsibility, and over time it can become emotionally and physically exhausting.\nCaregivers often have to fight for services, explain their child’s needs to others, deal with unwanted comments and manage daily challenges, all of which can lead to stress, anxiety, and sometimes depression.\n2. What support systems or coping strategies have you seen make a meaningful difference for isolated or overwhelmed caregivers ?\nSupport groups - whether in person or online - can help caregivers feel less alone. Talking to other parents going through similar experiences can be comforting. Access to therapy or counselling can also be very helpful.\nSome of my patients have WhatsApp groups with other parents and that has really helped them. On a practical level, getting help with daily tasks, even from extended family or friends, can reduce the pressure.\nMaking time for self-care, even in small ways, is very important.\nI am a big believer in early intervention and getting a child help as soon as possible.\nApplied Behavioural Therapy in my experience has been very effective.\nWhen parents feel they have been proactive in getting their child help, they feel more at ease.\nCaregivers also need to remember that their wellbeing affects their ability to care for their child.\nSetting small, realistic goals for self-care - like short breaks, rest, or asking for help - can make a difference. Also, learning to say ‘no’ to unnecessary demands and focusing on what truly matters helps reduce burnout.\n3. What are some signs that a caregiver might be approaching burnout, and when should they consider seeking professional help?\nSigns of burnout include constant fatigue, irritability, feeling hopeless or disconnected, and trouble sleeping.\nIf a caregiver feels emotionally numb or begins to resent their role, it’s a serious warning sign.\nSeeking professional help, like counselling or therapy, can be very helpful and should be considered before things reach a breaking point.\n4. In your experience, how does the cultural context in Bahrain shape the caregiving experience for families of autistic individuals?\nIn Bahrain, some families still feel pressure to keep the diagnosis private due to stigma or misunderstanding about autism.\nThere are still myths and shame around developmental differences, which can stop people from asking for help.\nAlso, the misinformation about vaccines causing autism is still believed by some, which can add guilt or confusion to the caregiver’s experience.\n5. What services or initiatives currently exist in Bahrain to support caregivers, and where do you see opportunities for improvement?\nThere are some centres and organisations that provide support, such as therapy, early intervention programmes, and awareness events.\nReach Behavioural and Developmental Centre offers Applied Behavioural Analysis services for children with autism.\nAlia Autism Centre/School and Rife USA also provide therapy services for children with autism.\nThe Child and Family Foundation Centre offers psychometric testing and milestone evaluations.\nOmnia Centre provides treatment services.\nThe government initiative People of Determination provides care and support. Additionally, there is a monthly government allowance for children with autism, but eligibility is limited to Bahraini nationals or children of Bahraini mothers.\nHowever, many families still struggle to find affordable and consistent services and there’s a need for more public awareness, better-trained professionals, and more accessible mental health support specifically for caregivers.\n6. What advice would you give to new caregivers who may be feeling lost or emotionally overwhelmed?\nYou are not alone, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed.\nReach out for help - whether from professionals, other parents, or support groups.\nDon’t be afraid to ask questions or seek out information. Be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time.",
