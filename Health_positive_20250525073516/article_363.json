    "text": "The Trump administration marks a radical change in food policies, eliminating all synthetic additives derived from petroleum.\nIn an unprecedented decision, the Trump Administration announced, according to AFP, its intention to completely eliminate artificial colorings from foods sold in the United States. The measure, welcomed by both the scientific community and civil society, targets a category of food additives long accused of negative effects on public health, especially on children.\n• FDA: \"A radical change for public health\"\n\"We are effectively eliminating all petroleum-derived food colorings in the United States,\" said Marty Makary, the new head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), during a press conference held in Washington. In total, eight synthetic additives will be removed from the market by the end of 2026 at the latest. According to the FDA, the decision comes in the wake of a wave of scientific evidence linking the use of these substances to problems such as hyperactivity in children, diabetes and even cancer. \"For the past 50 years, American children have lived in a veritable toxic soup of artificial chemicals,\" said Makary, emphasizing the need for strong intervention to protect public health.\n• A rare political consensus\nThe decision comes a few months after the former Democratic administration proposed a ban on the dye Red 3 (E127 in Europe), already known for decades for its carcinogenic potential in animal studies. Unlike many other legislative measures, the FDA initiative generated bipartisan consensus in the US Congress, a rarity in the current political climate. This harmony is explained by the growing pressure from consumer rights organizations, which for years have warned about the risks of these additives and called for stricter regulation.\n• Popular dyes, but lacking nutritional value\nAmong the substances to be banned are Red 40 (E129), Yellow 5 (E102) and Yellow 6 (E110) - dyes that are extremely widespread in the American food industry. They can be found in products such as sweets, juices, cereals, sauces and snacks.\nPeter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), says that these additives do not bring any real nutritional benefit: \"They only serve commercial purposes - to make foods look redder, bluer, more appetizing than they actually are.\"\n• What's next for the industry and consumers?\nThe US food industry will have a transition period of almost two years, until the end of 2026, to adapt to the new regulations. During this time, manufacturers will be forced to find natural alternatives, such as beetroot extracts, curcumin or spirulina, already widely used in Europe and in the organic segment. For consumers, the measure could lead to cleaner and safer products, but also to a possible increase in prices, at least temporarily, due to the adaptation of recipes and supply chains.\nThe ban marked by the FDA positions the US closer to European standards, where many of these dyes are either banned or conditioned by clear warnings on the packaging. Thus, the measure could also influence other countries, which often look to the US as a model in terms of food regulations. It is also a clear signal that consumer protection is gaining ground over commercial interests, especially when it comes to children's health.",
