    "text": "Holly Ridge Volunteer Fire and Rescue achieves certification to offer higher-level care\nHOLLY RIDGE, N.C. (WECT) - The Holly Ridge Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department achieved a significant milestone for the staff and community.\nAccording to Chief Brandon Longo, thanks to financial support from the Town of Holly Ridge and collaboration with Onslow County EMS, the Holly Ridge Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department was able to elevate its EMS provider designation to Paramedic Non-Transport.\n“We are honored to contribute to our expanding community and fortunate to have committed volunteers and staff whose efforts are commendable,” said Chief Longo.\nThe paramedic non-transport designation means firefighter paramedics can perform life-saving procedures before taking the patient to the hospital.\n“This increase allows Holly Ridge to offer higher-level pre-hospital medical care,” Chief Longo said. “The department will be onboarding additional Firefighter Paramedics to ensure the availability of this service around the clock.”\nCopyright 2025 WECT.
