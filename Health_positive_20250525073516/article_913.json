    "text": "Earlier this year, parents celebrated that the Food Drug Administration (FDA) banned Red Dye No.3 , a petroleum-based food additive found in popsicles, candy, certain medicines, and more. Now in a press conference this week, the FDA announced it would be working with the food industry to phase out eight other petroleum-based food dyes , including Red Dye 40, found in many processed foods like cereal, snacks, and drinks. The agency stops short of a ban on the dyes, however, with FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary saying, “let’s start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes, but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly.”\nBut what does “quickly” actually mean? For the Red Dye No. 3 ban, Makary said the FDA is requesting that food companies move up the previous 2027-2028 deadline for the ban. And with the FDA asking for “voluntary” and “friendly” cooperation from food companies on phasing out these additional food dyes by the end of next year, it could take more time. As Consumer Reports wrote in a statement , “The plan is short on details on what action the agencies will take if food companies fail to remove the dyes by the end of 2026” and encourages states to enact bans in the meantime. Others, like dietitian Jessica Knurick, PhD, RDN , suggested via Instagram that the lack of a formal ban is “performative politics” by the administration.\nPhasing out artificial food dyes feels like the right thing to do, but without a formal ban, plan, or clear timing, here’s what parents should know.\nWhich Artificial Food Dyes Will Be Phased Out? The eight food dyes include: FD&C Green No. 3, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 5, FD&C Yellow No. 6, FD&C Blue No. 1, and FD&C Blue No. 2. The agency will also revoke the authorization of Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B.\nWhich Foods Have Red 40 and Other Synthetic Dyes? According to the Consumer Reports statement, “the dyes are found in thousands of food and drink products and are used to make them brightly colored and visually appealing.” Think Fruit Loops cereal, Skittles candies, Cheetos crunchy snacks, and Gatorade sports drinks. Part of the worry with artificial food dyes is that these artificial colors make these processed foods extra-appealing to kids versus healthier alternatives.\nSource: bhofack2 | Canva Which Natural Food Dyes Will Be Used Instead? According to the FDA’s report, “the agency is fast-tracking the review of calcium phosphate, Galdieria extract blue, gardenia blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and other natural alternatives to synthetic food dyes. The agency is also taking steps to issue guidance and provide regulatory flexibilities to industries.”\nWhat Harmful Effects Have Been Linked to Artificial Food Dyes? According to Makary, “We have a new epidemic of childhood diabetes, obesity, depression, and ADHD. Given the growing concerns of doctors and parents about the potential role of petroleum-based food dyes, we should not be taking risks and do everything possible to safeguard the health of our children.”\nHealth and Human Services Director Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also said, “For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent… These poisonous compounds offer no nutritional benefit and pose real, measurable dangers to our children’s health and development.”\nBut are “poison” and “dangers” accurate descriptors?\nMelissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association issued a response saying, “The ingredients used in America’s food supply have been rigorously studied following an objective science and risk-based evaluation process and have been demonstrated to be safe.” She continued, “As we increase the use of alternative ingredients, food and beverage companies will not sacrifice science or the safety of our products.”\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic , “Some studies show a link between dyes and increased ADHD or hyperactivity in children. And other studies show an improvement in behavior and attention once the dyes were eliminated. Still, more research is needed.”\nThe good news is that research was also part of the FDA announcement . The agency said it will offer some regulatory flexibility to the industry and will partner with the National Institutes of Health to do more research on food additives to determine their effects on children’s health.\nWhat Else Can Parents Do? While parents wait for the plans to come to fruition and more research to be done, reading labels, prioritizing healthy food choices, and observing children’s behavior after eating certain foods are some steps to take. Dr. Jennifer Woo Baidal , an associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford University and pediatric gastroenterologist at Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, offered parents some additional reassurances in an article for NPR . She said parents need not be alarmed by the occasional consumption of processed foods with synthetic dyes as a small amount, “is not going to make or break things.”\nBut many of the foods containing synthetic food dyes also include high sugar levels. And the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting the amount of sugar in your child’s diet to moderate levels. “Sugar has plenty of calories… but very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods.” Dr. Woo Baidal also recommended “parents focus on children’s overall pattern of eating. The bulk of their diet should consist of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains.” Which is really good nutritional advice for all of us.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Kathy Sisson, Senior Editor Kathy Sisson has been a key contributor in the editorial parenting space for eight years, not only as a full-time editor at The Everymom but previously as a freelance writer for top parenting sites, including Scary Mommy , Motherly , Parent Co. , and more.
