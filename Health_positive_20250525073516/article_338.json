    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - April is Occupational Therapy Month, a month to recognize the impact occupational therapists have on people’s lives.\nAnna Stach has been an OT for 12 years and works at the Good Samaritan Society Sioux Falls Center.\n“We’re experts at working on what people want and need to be able to do in their daily lives, with a focus on quality of life and getting back their independence and maintaining that independence,” said Stach.\nStach sees eight to 10 patients a day, and every session is different in what goal they’re working toward.\n“Some need to work on their balance and some need to work on their strength, so our focus is to work on those goals we have set for somebody to either transition home or just be more independent in the environment they’re living. We really focus on the activities that people want and need to be able to do, the things you need to do, brush your teeth, dress, take yourself to the bathroom, showering, but we can also look at things that you really just want to do. Maybe it’s gardening, maybe it’s crocheting, that’s really our focus,” said Stach.\nStach points out a career that focuses on helping people regain independence can be very rewarding.\n“There’s so much pride and passion for being an OT just because we really are working on quality of life, a huge focus for our patient. So, when we leave, we know that we did something that helped that patient be more independent towards their goal. When somebody comes in and they’ve had a major condition and they’re going through a really hard time and we help them meet other patients that are also going through a really hard time and when they are able to walk out that door and go back home, it really is, it’s what we do it for,” said Stach.\nCopyright 2025 Dakota News Now.
