    "text": "- Net service revenue rose to $594.8 million, up from $571.4 million in Q1 2024.\n- Net income attributable to Amedisys (\nAMED,Financial) surged to $61.0 million from $14.4 million year-over-year. - Adjusted EBITDA increased to $68.8 million from $59.9 million in the previous year.\nAmedisys, Inc. (AMED) reported robust financial results for the first quarter of 2025, with net service revenue climbing to $594.8 million, reflecting a $23.4 million increase from $571.4 million in the same period last year. This marks a 4.1% year-over-year revenue growth.\nThe company, which specializes in home health, hospice, and high acuity care, noted a substantial increase in net income attributable to Amedisys, which reached $61.0 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $14.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in Q1 2024.\nThe financial performance was influenced by a notable $48.1 million gain on an equity method investment and $16.8 million in merger-related expenses. Despite these one-time factors, the adjusted metrics also showed positive growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 14.9% to $68.8 million from $59.9 million, while adjusted net income increased to $41.6 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, compared to $33.9 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, the previous year.\nAmedisys continues to operate 519 care centers across 38 states, serving approximately 499,000 patients annually. The balance sheet remains strong with $284.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, aligning the company well for future challenges, including the ongoing merger discussions with UnitedHealth Group, which are facing some regulatory hurdles.",
