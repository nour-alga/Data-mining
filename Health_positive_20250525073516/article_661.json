    "text": "The scariest episode of this Doctor Who season also was an illuminating one, for showrunner Russell T Davies.\nThe Saturday, April 26 episode, “The Well” — which series leads Ncuti Gatwa and Varada Sethu both flagged (in the video above) as the season’s “scariest” hour, and “a psychological thriller” — takes place 500,000 years in the future, on a brutal planet that is home to a devastated mining colony which has only one survivor.\nRose Ayling-Ellis with Varada Sethu and Ncuti Gatwa Courtesy of Disney Rose Ayling-Ellis, an English television presenter and writer of children’s books whose previous acting credits include EastEnders and Casualty , plays that lone survivor of an unspeakable incident, named Aliss.\nAyling-Ellis has been deaf since birth, but that quality was not endemic to the character as originally conceived.\n“Aliss wasn’t written as a deaf character,” Davies told TVLine ahead of the new season. “But then Rose’s name came up, and she’s acted for long time on British television, and I instantly said yes. Because she’s just wonderful .”\nDavies went on to say that one reason to “cast diversely,” as he happened to do here, is because all involved can learn a thing or two along the way. In turn, an episode of TV can only get better.\n“It was a delight to work with Rose. As I talked with her, we put things into the script I never would have thought of,” he recalled. “She modified things, and we modified things….”\nAfter submitting the script for “The Well” for a compliance reading — where typically “they tell us what we’ve gotten wrong , which is exactly the way it should work,” Davies explained — this time “it came back with such a glowing report.”\nIn fact, one of the few notes he did receive celebrated a line of dialogue, about how hearing people can get paranoid around those who are quietly signing. “ I’ve never seen that said out loud before ,” is what Davies said the impressed consultant on deafness reported back.\nAs for Ayling-Ellis’ acting performance as Aliss, “I don’t want to give away too much…,” the showrunner hedged, adding: “Is she the villain? Maybe she’s behind it all?”\nBut this much he affirmed: “Oh my God, she gives so much that your heart absolutely goes out to her. I’m so lucky to talk about her, and to work with her.”\nWant scoop on Doctor Who , or for any other TV show ?
