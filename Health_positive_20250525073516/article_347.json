    "text": "Nemours Children's Health and Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union are now teammates.\nA collaboration months in the making was certified Wednesday at the children's hospital in Wilmington. According to Nemours Chair of Orthopedic Surgery Dr. Suken Shah, the Union has an academy which houses and trains about 85 young people who aspire to a career in soccer. Medical specialists with Nemours will be taking care of the team.\n\"We're going to be providing physicals, orthopedic surgery, baseline concussion testing and any medical referrals that they might need throughout the year,\" Shah said.\nSeveral Union players took part in the announcement and visited with young patients Wednesday.\nUnion Chief Revenue Officer Charlie Slonaker said the team is on the only one in MLS with a school, training facility and stadium at the same complex.\n\"Nemours will be our team docs, so they're going to be partners hand in hand with our training staff to make sure our players receive best-in-class care,\" Slonaker said.\nNemours will also be featured at several Union home games, including Kids' Day Saturday April 26th vs. DC United.\n\"It's bringing together two great organizations in this area to celebrate the community and well as engagement,\" Shah said.",
