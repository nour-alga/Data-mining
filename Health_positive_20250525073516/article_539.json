    "text": "Punjab Health Minister urges children to unite in fight against drugs at Patiala marathon\nPunjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr Balbir Singh has called upon children to unite against drugs and come forward to make Punjab drug-free. He announced that such students will be honoured by the Punjab government at the district and state levels.\nHe flagged off the war against drugs marathon organised by the district administration from the Polo Ground this morning.\nDescribing children as our heroes, the Health Minister motivated them to not only stay away from drugs themselves but also to make the people around them aware of the harmful effects of drugs.\nAddressing a large gathering of over 10,000 students, teachers and social workers from various schools, colleges, and other institutions, the health minister stressed upon the initiatives like ‘Khedan Watan Punjab Diyan’.\nSingh appealed to the children to take inspiration from our national heroes like Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Baba Sahib Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Lal Bahadur Shastri, etc and become role models.\nOn this occasion, Deputy Commissioner Dr Preeti Yadav and SSP Nanak Singh congratulated the health minister and all the participants in the marathon, saying that the enthusiasm and zeal with which the people of Patiala and the students have participated in this marathon gives her hope that Patiala district will definitely become drug-free.\nThe route of the marathon, organized in collaboration with the police, education, health, and sports departments, started at Polo Ground and passed through YPS Chowk, Thikriwal, Fuhara Chowk, Leela Bhawan, Baradari, Sheranwala Gate, and Phul Cinema before concluding back at Polo Ground via Modi College Chowk.\nLater while dedicating newly completed development projects in four schools of the Patiala Rural constituency to the students, the minister claimed that the sweeping transformation in government schools over the past three years has made them the preferred choice for parents. “From blackboards to digital screens, our students now learn through modern tools, which has greatly enhanced their confidence and engagement,” he further added.",
