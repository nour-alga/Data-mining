    "text": "Teddi Mellencamp is celebrating “exciting news” amid her battle with cancer.\n“Honestly, the crying is already done, but I just finished with all of my scans and my tumors have significantly shrunk, which doctors believe means that this all will work and that I will be back to myself and feeling good,” Mellencamp, 43, said in a Wednesday, April 23, Instagram video.\nMellencamp explained that she has two more sessions of immunotherapy and then will “hopefully” be done and cancer-free.\n“I’m going to keep a positive outlook because that’s the way my doctor just spoke to me. He’s like, ‘You did this, you got this,’” she said, before imitating: “‘You got that Mellencamp blood, so you’re good.’”\n“One update I couldn’t wait to share!” Mellencamp captioned her post. “All tumors stage 4 (metastasized melanoma in my brain and lungs) shrunk or disappeared so I have 6ish more weeks of immunotherapy and doctors believe I will be healed if everything stays on course. Thank you to everyone who has sent their love, prayers, and positivity ❤️❤️❤️.”\nMellencamp’s pals quickly weighed in on the news in the comments section of her post. “BEST DAY EVER So grateful😭❤️,” Kyle Richards wrote, while Tamra Judge added, “I can’t stop crying tears of joy … I love you 😘.”\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, who shared in February that “multiple tumors” had been found on her brain, has been candid about her cancer battle. While revealing exclusively to Us Weekly in March that doctors found four more tumors on her brain, Mellencamp shared that she’s “fighting for my life,” adding, “But also for my family’s life and all the people I love.”\nMellencamp, who shared that one of her coping mechanisms is sarcasm, noted that she stays positive by planning things to look forward to.\nRelated: Teddi Mellencamp Has 4 More Brain Tumors: Inside Her Cancer Battle During her three seasons on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, we saw Teddi Mellencamp in her fair share of arguments and confrontations. But nothing could prepare her for the monumental battle she’s facing now. “I’m fighting for my life,” she tells Us Weekly, “But also for my family’s life and all the people I […] “A lot of people — not doctors, strangers on the internet — said [I] shouldn’t be riding, but it’s one of the things I love doing with my daughter. And I’m really lucky that Edwin [Arroyave] , who I was in the middle of a divorce from, we put everything on hold. [It] wasn’t really the time to be fighting over emails. He’s been extremely kind and helping with the kids . That’s made things a lot easier.”\nMellencamp, who shares daughter Slate, 12, son Cruz, 10, and daughter Dove, 5, with estranged husband Arroyave, added that she’s excited to go “back to normal” after treatment. (Arroyave is also dad to daughter Isabella, 16, from a previous relationship. He and Mellencamp announced their separation in 2024.)\n“I want to try new things, travel more with the kids, keep building a life and doing the best that we can, and have fun together,” she told Us . “That’s my goal.”",
