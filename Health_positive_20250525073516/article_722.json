    "text": "JMCGH ceremony celebrates, honors organ donors during National Donate Life Month\nJACKSON, Tenn. — One local hospital holds a ceremony to honor organ donors and their recipients.\nDuring April, the Jackson-Madison County General Hospital honors organ donors who have given the gift of life and those whose lives have been saved.\nThey also presented the first ever James Ross Angel of Hope Award to the Critical Care Unit.\n“There are about 3,000 Tennesseans today that are waiting on a life-saving gift of an organ, and unless they receive that gift, unfortunately, they’ll pass away, and about 100,000 Americans in that same position. So, only if we have organ donors can we save those lives. So, it’s important to realize that all of us perhaps have the opportunity to save lives through organ donation,” said Byron Elam, external affairs coordinator for Tennessee Donor Services.\nSEE ALSO:\n[Record-breaking year for organ donors at JMCGH, Mayor presents proclamation]\nWith 34 donors and 79 lives saved, 2024 was a record breaking year at the hospital. During the ceremony, guests paid tribute to their loved ones by leaving messages on wooden birds that were placed on a memorial tree.\nWe heard from one family who not only received an organ, but their son donated as well.\n“You never know as you go through life at a young age or old age what life’s gonna bring. I retired from the police department in Jackson, TN. I was working the day I got the call that I needed to go home. So, my son was killed by a drunk driver; he was 7 years old. So I went to the house, and being in law enforcement I knew that he wasn’t gonna make it,” said Loran Newton, organ donor recipient.\nOrgan donation impacts the family just as much as the patient.\n“Please, please donate. I’m so thankful for our donor because without them, we wouldn’t have had my daddy. He wouldn’t have been able to walk me down the aisle,” said Melissa Hogeland, family of organ donor and donor recipient.\nThe Jackson-Madison County General Hospital encourages people to consider organ donation.
