    "text": "The Senate unanimously passed a measure that would implement labeling requirements for specific foods containing vaccines or vaccine materials.\nSarasota Republican Sen. Joe Gruters presented the bill ( SB 196 ), which received unanimous support during its passage through committee hearings.\nThe bill’s analysis states that the regulation of drugs and cosmetics is intended to protect public health and public welfare by protecting consumers against any injuries or merchandising deceit.\nThe legislation would prohibit the use of fruit and vegetables as a delivery mechanism for mRNA vaccines. The analysis notes that recent studies have been looking into ways of implanting DNA containing mRNA into lettuce and other plant foods that could contain similar amounts of mRNA used in shots like the COVID vaccine.\nThe analysis further states that the legislation would establish that any food containing a vaccine or vaccine materials sold without labeling alerting the consumer would be classed as a misbranded drug.\nCertain ingredients included in cosmetics, like formaldehyde, that are manufactured, sold, offered or distributed in Florida would be required to have a warning included on the product’s single-use packaging.\nIn-state retailers would be authorized to exhaust existing stock up until July 1, 2027, and would be subject to disciplinary action. Cosmetic products regulated as drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would be exempt.\nThe Department of Business and Professional Regulation ( DBPR ) would have authority over rulemaking and inspecting permittees for any violations. Disciplinary action could include seizure and condemnation of misbranded drugs, and suspension or removal of a permit.\nThe bill’s analysis notes that currently Florida does not have a facility for testing cosmetic products, nor does it have a routine process in place.\nUpdating packaging and labeling of cosmetics that contain certain ingredients was determined to have an indeterminate negative fiscal impact on the state budget for both the DBPR and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\nThere could also have been additional costs associated with conducting laboratory tests of food products for vaccines or vaccine materials, as well as cosmetic testing for restricted chemicals.",
