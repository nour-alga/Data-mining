    "text": "The Lizzo Ozempic rumors have been shut down again. During a recent TikTok livestream, the “Good As Hell” singer discussed the secrets behind her weight loss. Despite many fans speculating she took medication to achieve a smaller figure, Lizzo said her transformation was done naturally through a calorie deficit.\nThe Truth Behind Those Lizzo Ozempic Rumors Lizzo explained that making small lifestyle changes helped her lose weight. One thing she’s implemented in recent years is counting calories. Once she became committed to keeping track of everything she ate, Lizzo realized that sweets made up a large potion of her daily intake. So, she gradually started eliminating them from her diet. The star said she stopped consuming “two to three” Starbucks drinks everyday, which amounted to 1,200 calories. She also replaced “sugary” breakfast meals with “super savory” foods.\nAlthough she wouldn’t normally recommend counting calories as a form of weight loss, Lizzo said it’s what worked best for her since she previously had a problem with bingeing. “Across the board, science-wise, [what helped me was] calories in versus calories out,” she said.\nLizzo explained that her mental health played a huge role in her relationship with food. Due to her anxiety, she would find ways to “distract” herself, like turning to drinking or eating. Once she stopped ignoring her anxiety and tackled it head on, Lizzo was able to improve her diet. While going into a calorie deficit helped with her weight loss, Lizzo said it’s not for everyone. “Everybody’s body is different. Find out what works for you,” she said.\nFans Always Assume It’s Ozempic The Lizzo Ozempic rumors are nothing new. The pop star has been accused of taking the medication repeatedly throughout her weight loss journey. In fact, the allegations became so widespread that they were even mentioned during a South Park special last May. After it aired, Lizzo poked fun at the Ozempic rumors by dressing up as the weight-loss drug for Halloween. She even created a fake ad to go along with her costume. “Need self love? Try Lizzo!” the poster read.\nAnother celebrity who’s been accused of using Ozempic recently is Meghan Trainor. The singer shocked fans when she debuted a slimmer figure at the 2025 Billboard Women In Music Awards. She was asked about her transformation during a red carpet interview at the event. Although she admitted she learned “a lot of tricks” for weight loss, she didn’t mention Ozempic. Instead, she credited her appearance to a new workout routine.\nRelated: Meghan Trainor Reveals Secrets to Weight Loss Amid Ozempic Accusations: ‘I Learned A Lot of Tricks’ Trainor explained she had tried to lose weight by doing cardio. However, once it failed to give her results, she changed her routine to incorporate a more diverse set of workouts.\nIt seems what Lizzo said was right. Not every weight-loss method will work for everybody. It’s all about figuring out what works best for you.",
