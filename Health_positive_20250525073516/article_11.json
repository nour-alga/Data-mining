    "text": "Oceaneering International, Inc. (\"Oceaneering\") ( NYSE: OII ) today reported first quarter 2025 results.\nRevenue of $675 million, a 13% increase year over year Operating income of $73.5 million, a 100% increase year over year Net income of $50.4 million, a 233% increase year over year Adjusted EBITDA of $96.7 million, a 57% increase year over year, which has not been adjusted for a $10.4 million inventory reserve taken in our Manufactured Products segment Cash flow used in operating activities of $(80.7) million and free cash flow of $(107) million, with an ending cash position of $382 million Share repurchases of 479,154 for approximately $10.0 million Rod Larson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Oceaneering, stated, \"Oceaneering outperformed expectations this quarter due to resilient utilization of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and strong vessel activity predominately in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $96.7 million, exceeding both our guidance range and consensus estimates for the quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, our consolidated first quarter 2025 operating income doubled on a 13% increase in revenue, driven by strong performances from our Subsea Robotics (SSR) and Offshore Projects Group (OPG) segments. In addition, our Aerospace and Defense Technologies (ADTech) segment was awarded the largest initial contract in Oceaneering's history, which is foundational to our 2025 guidance for significant growth in this segment. On behalf of our leadership team, I want to thank our Oceaneers worldwide who made these results possible.\"\nUpdated 2025 guidance\nMr. Larson continued, \"We reiterate our prior full-year 2025 guidance of EBITDA in the range of $380 million to $430 million. As discussed during our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call, we lowered the bottom end of our guidance range to $380 million, in acknowledgment of potential market uncertainties. Given our strong start to 2025, we still believe this range is appropriate, even with recent market developments.\"\nFull-year 2025 consolidated and segment guidance remains the same as provided in the fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and call, with the addition that the Manufactured Products book-to-bill ratio is expected to be in the range of 0.9 to 1.0 for the full year.\nFirst Quarter 2025 Segment Results\nAs compared to the first quarter of 2024:\nSSR operating income improved 35% to $59.6 million on a 10% increase in revenue. EBITDA margin expanded to 35%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 413 basis points. ROV fleet utilization was 67% and ROV revenue per day utilized was $10,788, reflecting year-over-year improvements. Manufactured Products operating income of $8.7 million declined 34% on a 4% increase in revenue, with operating income margin declining year over year to 6%. These results were impacted by a $10.4 million adjustment taken during the quarter related to an inventory reserve associated with our theme park ride business. Backlog was $543 million on March 31, 2025, a 9% decrease compared with the same period in 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.90 for the 12-month period ending on March 31, 2025. OPG results improved significantly year over year, due to the continuation of international projects that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2024, improved vessel utilization in the Gulf of Mexico, and the reduction in drydock costs and the associated loss of vessel days that impacted the first quarter of 2024. Operating income grew to $35.7 million, revenue increased to $165 million, and operating income margin expanded to 22%. Integrity Management and Digital Solutions (IMDS) operating income of $3.5 million, operating income margin of 5%, and revenue of $71.4 million were relatively flat. ADTech revenue was relatively flat at $97.2 million. Operating income decreased $2.1 million to $10.7 million and operating income margin declined to 11%, due to readiness costs to enable our role as a prime contractor on the recently announced large contract award. At the corporate level, Unallocated Expenses of $44.6 million were in line with guidance for the quarter. Second Quarter 2025 Guidance\nAs compared to the second quarter of 2024, consolidated second quarter 2025 revenue is expected to increase and EBITDA is projected to increase to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million.\nAt the segment level, for the second quarter of 2025, as compared to the second quarter of 2024:\nSSR revenue and operating profitability are expected to increase. Manufactured Products revenue is projected to be relatively flat and operating profitability is expected to improve. OPG revenue is forecasted to be relatively flat and operating profitability is forecast to improve significantly. IMDS revenue is expected to be relatively flat and operating profitability is expected to improve. ADTech revenue is projected to increase and operating profitability is projected to improve significantly. Unallocated Expenses are expected to be in the $45 million range. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and on a segment basis (as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins); and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impacts of certain identified items. Reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP measures are shown in the tables Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share (EPS), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and Margins, Free Cash Flow, 2025 Consolidated EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Estimates, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and Margins by Segment. These tables are included below under the caption Reconciliations of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Information.\nConference Call Details\nOceaneering has scheduled a conference call and webcast on Thursday, April 24, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, to discuss its results for the first quarter of 2025 and guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2025. Interested parties may listen to the call through a webcast link posted in the Investor Relations section of Oceaneering's website. A replay of the conference call will be made available on the website approximately two hours following the conclusion of the live call.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements as to the expectations, beliefs, future expected business, and financial performance and prospects of Oceaneering.

We have included Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share, each of which excludes the effects of certain specified items, as set forth in the tables that follow. As a result, these amounts are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these are useful measures for investors to review because they provide consistent measures of the underlying results of our ongoing business. Furthermore, our management uses these measures as measures of the performance of our operations. We have also included disclosures of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), EBITDA Margins, 2024 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, and 2025 Consolidated EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Estimates, as well as the following by segment: EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins and related information by segment exclude the effects of certain specified items, as set forth in the tables that follow. Due to the forward-looking nature of EBITDA for the second quarter of 2025 and for the full year of 2025, we cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary line-items for the reconciliations to net income and, accordingly, have excluded such line-items in the reconciliation. EBITDA and EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins, and related information by segment are each non-GAAP financial measures. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by operating activities less organic capital expenditures ( i.e ., purchases of property and equipment other than those in business acquisitions). We have included these disclosures in this press release because EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, and Free Cash Flow are widely used by investors for valuation purposes and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies in our industry, and the adjusted amounts thereof provide more consistent measures than the unadjusted amounts. Furthermore, our management uses these measures for purposes of evaluating our financial performance. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, and Free Cash Flow (and the Adjusted amounts thereof) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as substitutes for our reported operating results, cash flows, or any other measure prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP. The tables that follow provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP FINANCIAL
