    "text": "New all-terrain wheelchair aims to make Lexington nature sanctuary more accessible\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Parts of Raven Run Nature Sanctuary in Lexington can be difficult to traverse for anybody, but now, with the help of a new all-terrain wheelchair, some of the most beautiful hiking trails that are hard to get to can be experienced by everyone.\nThe Action Trackchair gives people who have issues with mobility the ability to enjoy nature no matter how rough the terrain.\n“It’s been so much that has not been available to the people who have mobility issues at Raven Run,” said Adrienne Thakur, the Deputy Director of Recreation at Lexington Parks and Recreation. “The ability to go off into the fully forested area and experience the wildlife and the plants and the wildflowers to take a forest bath and get completely away from the man-made entities and buildings in the park.”\nA team within Lexington’s Park and Rec advocated for the trackchair for many years after some in the public wanted more trail accessibility.\nThe city paid $19,000 for this vehicle, and it comes with several safety features, including seat belts, an emergency stop and an anti-rollback device.\n“Our staff at Raven Run has done a great job of mapping the trail to make sure the chair can be used safely and appropriately on the routes that are chosen,” said Thakur.\nKristy Stambaugh is the city’s Director of Aging and Disability Services.\n“It’s really nice and responsive,” Stambaugh said. “I think as we get older, we say, ‘Gosh, I wish I could... I wish I could go through the meadow at Raven Run. Oh, but I’m worried about the mole holes. I’m worried about the rocks or I’m worried about the terrain,’ and so this track chair is going to open that up because it’s going to take away that worry.”\nStambaugh says she’ll let the seniors she serves know about this Trackchair, but there might be a waiting list for reservations. This is the only one available, but there are discussions to purchase another one.\nThe Action Trackchair is free to use.\nReservation times can be found here.\nCopyright 2025 WKYT.
