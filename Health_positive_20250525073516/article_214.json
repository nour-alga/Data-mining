    "text": "Tennessee Aquarium IMAX Theater Hosts Sensory-Friendly Screenings This Spring\nChattanooga, TN – (WDEF)The Tennessee Aquarium IMAX Theater is making movie magic more inclusive this spring with special sensory-friendly screenings designed for guests with sensory processing needs.\nThe first film, Call of the Dolphins, will be shown on Saturday, April 26. The second, Elephants: Giants of the Desert, follows on Saturday, May 31. Both screenings begin at 10:30 a.m.\nThese screenings offer a welcoming environment for anyone who may benefit from sensory accommodations. The theater will lower the volume, dim the lights, and reduce overall capacity to create a more relaxed, judgment-free experience.\n“Anyone who can benefit from accommodations for sensory sensitivity is welcome,” said Mara-Lynne Payne, Director of Inclusion, Equity and Diversity. “A lot of times, theaters can feel overwhelming. So we make adjustments—lowering the lights, turning down the volume, and limiting capacity so people can move around freely or vocalize if they need to, without any judgment.”\nSensory support items like noise-canceling headphones, weighted lap pads, and fidget tools will be available for guests. For those needing a break during the film, quiet areas—including the IMAX Theater’s peaceful garden—will also be open.\nSensory-friendly screenings are set for April 26 and May 31.\nTo learn more or reserve tickets, visit the Tennessee\nAquarium’s website.",
