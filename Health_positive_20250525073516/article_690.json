    "text": "Gas station employees, first responders save man’s life after falling off of bridge\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Employees at an East Louisville gas station helped save a man’s life after he fell 15 to 20 feet off a bridge and into a creek.\nThe incident happened behind a Speedway located at 11301 Westport Road near Fincastle.\nA worker noticed the man had fallen and called 911. That’s when employee Aaron Biddix was called over to help.\n“I just called out can you give me your name? Can you give me anything? No response,” Biddix said. “His chest was rising for a second and then he started having a little bit of a death rattle and it slowly stopped rising.”\nBiddix had CPR training after previously working as a lifeguard. He recognized the man was losing his pulse and started right away on chest compressions.\n“I hopped down there, about a five, six-foot drop,” Biddix said. “I tried to get him over to another part of the creek with a more stable base so I could do compressions, but by that time he didn’t have a pulse so I figured I might as well just go in and start.”\nWhen first responders with Anchorage Middletown Fire & EMS arrived at the scene, the man had already regained his pulse.\nSamantha Kimbler was one of the paramedics on scene. She described how crews had to call in a rescue company to lift the man out of the creek. The area was heavily wooded, making it hard to pull him to safety.\n“We have a special rescue company that specializes in specific types of patient recues,” Kimbler said. “They were dispatched to assist us, and they used chainsaws to cut a path.”\nAfter clearing a space, the company used a special stretcher called a Stokes basket to lift the man.\n“You set that spine board down in there, it has multiple handles on it,” Kimbler said. “It secures the patient and makes it easier to carry them through wilderness, vegetation, anything like that.”\nParamedics made sure the man was stable as he was transported to UofL Hospital. Kimbler says these are the kind of challenging rescues their department trains to be prepared for.\n“I’m really proud of our team,” Kimbler said. “I’m proud of our department. We work really well together. We train for unknown scenarios and this is why.”\nBiddix said he’s glad to know his quick thinking under pressure could’ve saved the man’s life.\n“It’s just not panicking when the situation calls for it,” Biddix said. “So that’s what I did. I think I just helped a person in need.”\nCopyright 2025 WAVE. All rights reserved.",
