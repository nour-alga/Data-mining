    "text": "Wrist pain can be the result of some short temporal assault or a long-term condition. The symptoms of the pain vary according to the underlying cause. For example, pain due to osteoarthritis is dull, whereas pain from a fracture is sharp and more annoying. Wrist pain is a prevalent disease that leads to debilitation worldwide. The prevalence of wrist pain is said to be about 10 per cent in the general population. The frequent usage of wrists for working and bearing weight makes them susceptible to injuries and stresses. Wrist pain can also be caused by fracture, tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, cysts (ganglion), arthritis (rheumatoid and osteoarthritis), or inflammation. One may feel the following symptoms with the pain: swelling, joint stiffness, redness of overlying skin, warmth, and tenderness. Victims should seek expert advice if the pain is intense and lasts longer than a few days, or if a crack is heard, motion becomes impaired, or severe swelling occurs. Helpful botanicals to relieve wrist pain Certain botanical treatments, which have proven to help ease hand pain, include the following: Garlic – the herb possesses powerful anti-inflammatory properties shown to ease pains in the wrist. The way garlic is processed or prepared can really change its health benefits. The enzyme alliinase, which converts alliin into the beneficial allicin, only works under certain conditions. It can also be deactivated by heat. Studies have shown that as little as 1 minute of microwaving or 45 minutes in the oven can deactivate alliinase. Since most of the therapeutic potentials of the vegetable are lost through cooking, many studies suggest that raw or aged garlic is most effective in pain management/reduction. Here are a few ways to optimize the health benefits of garlic: Ensure whole garlic is crushed, chewed, or sliced before it is taken. Let crushed garlic stand for 5-10 minutes before you cook it. This increases the allicin content as well as prevents the loss of the medicinal properties of garlic. You could add a few more garlic cloves to your meals to compensate for the effects of cooking. Use more than one clove per meal if you’re feeling brave! Shun the notorious garlicky odour; your body will surely be happy. You may use some mints afterwards! To maximize the benefit of this valuable vegetable, do not always cook it. You can add some raw, crushed garlic to a homemade salad dressing or juice, for example, and this would avoid any cooking. You can make apple juice with garlic: 1-2 apples, quartered; 1 medium cucumber with its peel; 1 clove of garlic, peeled. Blend all together and enjoy this refreshing ”Garlicky Apple Booster”. Do not let your wrist pain knock you down. Garlic supplementation is perfect for knocking out the pains! Mustard – another herb that is prominent in bringing about relief from wrist ache and wrist tendonitis is mustard. Mustard seeds have long been used to treat inflammation of the body. The natural anti-inflammatory properties of this botanical are attributed mainly to its selenium and magnesium contents. The selenium has been shown to help decrease some of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and gout. The magnesium may restore normal sleep patterns in people having difficulty with the symptoms associated with wrist pains. Mustard seeds also contain Omega-3 fatty acids, which further help reduce inflammation and its accompanying secondary symptoms. Consuming mustard can be a beneficial step in providing relief. It is recommended to chew about 10 gm of mustard seeds and drink a glass of water, kept under room temperature 2 X daily. The topical application of a mustard plaster has proven to reduce inflammation in arthritic joints. Cayenne pepper – powerful pain relieving spice! Cayenne pepper, like all hot chilli peppers, is rich in the chemical compound capsaicin. It is this compound that brings about pain relief. A study investigated the effect of capsaicin on nerve pain and found positive effects. Therefore, it can be said that nerve pain arising from Carpal Tunnel syndrome can also be alleviated using the spice. Topical capsaicin – when applied to the hand, capsaicin provides a heating sensation that blocks pain signals. This provides relief from muscle or joint pain. Black pepper – piperine is the active ingredient in black pepper. This property is the cause of the pungent smell you get when black pepper gets near you. This alkaloid plays an important role in providing you with pain relief. A study carried out on rats found that piperine significantly reduces pain in lumbar disc herniation cases by reducing pro-inflammatory factors. Black pepper and turmeric multiply the analgesic properties. According to some studies, the combination of piperine and curcumin has shown to be immensely beneficial in managing pain in osteoarthritis patients. Curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric. It has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce pain and swelling. Therefore, a combination of turmeric and black pepper will be ideal in achieving pain relief. Plant-based foods – Many diets are high in fat and sugar, which increases inflammation. Diets that are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other plant-based foods provide nutrients that reduce inflammation. This can improve function and decrease pain. Also MassageMassaging the hand and the area where the wrist and forearm meet can ease muscle tension and reduce pain. A professional hand massage can increase greater grip strength when done weekly and followed up with a daily self-massage at home.",
