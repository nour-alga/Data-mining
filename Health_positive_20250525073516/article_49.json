    "text": "Pfizer (PFE, Financial) is set to unveil pivotal data on its innovative cancer therapies at the upcoming 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, scheduled from May 30 to June 3 in Chicago. The company will present findings from over 60 studies, encompassing a wide range of cancer types, including breast, colorectal, genitourinary, hematologic, and thoracic cancers. The presentations will include nine oral and six rapid oral sessions.\nNotably, Pfizer will spotlight two key late-breaking oral presentations during ASCO’s pre-meeting press briefing on May 27. One will focus on the primary analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival data from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER study. This study examines the efficacy of BRAFTOVI combined with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 in treating patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. The other significant presentation will reveal progression-free survival results from the Phase 3 VERITAC-2 study of vepdegestrant, in collaboration with Arvinas, for patients with certain advanced or metastatic breast cancers.\nFurther, Pfizer will provide updates on significant late-stage projects, including five-year survival data from the Phase 3 ARCHES study of XTANDI (enzalutamide) used with androgen deprivation therapy in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Additionally, Pfizer will present the first combination data for ELREXFIO, daratumumab, and lenalidomide from the MagnetisMM-6 study targeting newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients ineligible for transplants.\nPfizer is also exploring new avenues with vedotin antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
