    "text": "TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (WTWO/WAWV) – A national effort this weekend serves as a reminder to safely dispose of old prescription drugs. Saturday is recognized as National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. There will be a prescription drug disposal site set up outside Baesler’s Market on Saturday, April 26, from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Terre Haute Police, Drug Free Vigo County and Chances and Services For Youth are partnering to provide this event for the community. “You just don’t realize, maybe how much of expired medications you can accumulate over the years,” said Cammy Reed, Drug Free Vigo County Coordinator. “You think, ‘oh, it’s not a big deal,’ I’ll just leave it in my medicine cabinet, but there are a lot of people who have substance use problems, and maybe they might come over to your house. Maybe it’s a family member, and they might rummage through your cabinet, so it’s just safer to get rid of them.” In addition to prescription drug disposal, the event at Baesler’s will also offer document shredding.
