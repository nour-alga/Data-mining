    "text": "Efforts continue in Madison to expand Medicaid coverage for postpartum care; the cap currently at two months\nEAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) - A bill to expand Medicaid coverage for post partum care from two months to a full year passed the Wisconsin Senate Tuesday.\n“Overwhelmingly in the senate, it was 32 - 1,” said Republican State Senator Jesse James. “This is one of the most larger bipartisan bills that we’ve passed.”\nMothers like Cortney Nicholson who have just given birth and are in that window of time for postpartum complications could soon be further covered for medical care needed. She enjoyed her afternoon with her weeks-old baby. This is her second child, but she still recalls how difficult it was dealing with the not-so expected post birth experience.\n“When I look at the two months that Medicaid covers, that’s just barely nicking the surface,” said Nicholson. “With this being my second birth, with the first one, I wasn’t healed even into twelve weeks.”\nMothers around the Chippewa Valley shared this sentiment.\n“You need support all along to a year, sometimes even longer. But, to go to a year is amazing,” said Iris Casey, a mother of one and business owner of Mother Essence. She uses her business to help other mothers through postpartum by providing meals and helping with whatever a mother may need. “That whole journey myself led me to support other moms so they don’t have to go through something similar.”\n“When they say it takes a village to raise a kid, they absolutely mean it,” said Paige Drobot, a mother of two and a working doula. “I mainly focus on the actual birthing portion, but they do still reach out to me afterward.”\nDr. Christina Kramer with Oakleaf Clinics has worked as an OBGYN for decade. She, along with the rest of the mothers that work with mothers in postpartum, sees and at times feel the need for all the coverage and support needed for the post birth phase of a mother’s life.\n“There’s a lot of physical, emotional, psychological changes in the postpartum window. Postpartum mood disorders are extremely common. Up to 1 in 8 women experience some version,” said Dr. Kramer. “The process of pregnancy takes 9 to 10 months to occur. And, postpartum recovery takes as long.”\nDr. Kramer said she had also seen patients not keep up with care because of financial restraints and the two month limit on Medicaid coverage for post partum care in Wisconsin.\n“I want to take care of the patient, but financial costs can be a burden for a lot of our patients, which is not ideal,” said Dr. Kramer.\nThe bill will still need to clear the assembly before getting to Governor Ever’s desk.\nThere is help for mothers in the Chippewa Valley:\nMama Bear Family Care, on Facebook, they also have an expo coming up on August 2nd in Eau Claire.\nCopyright 2025 WEAU.
