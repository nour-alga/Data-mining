Seven Oral Presentations: Innovent to Present Breakthrough Clinical Data of IBI363（PD-1/IL-2α-bias）and Other Novel Drug Candidates at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting 24.04.25 01:00 Uhr Werbung SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU,China , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (\"Innovent\") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic, autoimmune, ophthalmology and other major diseases, announces that clinical data for its innovative bispecific antibodies and ADC molecules, including oral presentations for IBI363 (PD-1/IL-2 α -bias ) and IBI343 (CLDN18.2 ADC), will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2025 from May 30 to June 3, 2024 , in Chicago, Illinois , U.S.\nDr. Hui Zhou , Senior Vice President of Innovent, stated: \"We are delighted to announce that at 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting, the first wave of three indications under development for IBI363—melanoma, colorectal cancer(CRC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)—have all been accepted for oral presentations, highlighting the significant attention garnered by the next-generation bispecific antibodies, in particular PD-1-based immunotherapy. Additionally, following its oral presentation at ESMO Asia last December, the Phase 1b data of IBI343 in pancreatic cancer has once again secured an oral presentation at ASCO, further solidifying its potential in this challenging therapeutic area. The maturing PoC data for these innovative candidates has strengthened our confidence in advancing them into pivotal-stage development, with the goal of unlocking their clinical value for global unmet clinical needs. As one of the few biopharmaceutical companies with both the advanced technology platforms and robust pipeline in \"IO+ADC\" areas, Innovent will continue to make breakthroughs in the field of cancer treatment, and is committed to providing physicians and patients with more innovative, effective and safe treatment options.\"\nDetails on the abstracts are listed below:\nOral Presentation\n1.
