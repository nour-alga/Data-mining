    "text": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr announced plans to remove certain artificial dyes from the U.S. food and drug supply on April 22, taking a step toward fulfilling one of his campaign promises. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared intentions to \"phase out\" petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year during a press conference in which Kennedy called the additives \"poison,\" saying, \"For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent.\" While the FDA has said that \"the totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives, but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them,\" food advocates have commended the move, saying it's a step in the right direction. Here's what to know about the dyes that the FDA is looking to remove from American food. The FDA announced on April 22 that they will \"phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply\" by the end of 2026. However, no formal agreement or legislation was passed officially banning the substances. Instead, HHS and the FDA have a \"mutual understanding\" with the food industry that the dyes will be progressively removed, according to Kennedy. During an April 22 press conference, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency intends to revoke approvals for certain dyes and work alongside industry leaders to achieve elimination of the additives. A press statement released by the FDA also said it is working to \"establish a national standard and timeline for the transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives,\" but did not further specify formal regulatory or legislative actions. A statement from the watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), however, called the agreement's voluntary nature \"disappointing\" for its lack of \"rulemaking.\" \"Because using synthetic food dyes has always been voluntary, there is no incentive from today's announcement for manufacturers to switch to natural food colors.\" The FDA will authorize four new natural color additives and partner with the National Institutes of Health to conduct research on \"how food additives impact children’s health and development,\" according to the HHS. Studies have been done on the impacts of commonly used synthetic food dyes, some of which have found links to conditions like cancer, ADHD and organ damage . However, a universal scientific consensus on how much dye has to be consumed to prove a definitive cause-and-effect link between it and these health conditions has yet to be reached. As a result, different countries have implemented different rules over time as the scientific community learns more about the potential correlation between food additives and health. Also coming within months is an action to remove the use of: Some dyes that have been banned in the U.S. are still used in other countries like Canada and those in the European Union, while some still used in the U.S. are banned in other such countries. Some food dyes already banned from the US include: Some U.S. states were already moving toward removing some food dyes separate from the federal government. Red 3, for example, was banned in California, along with Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, via a bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2024. The most popular food dyes are Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, according to Healthline. These three make up 90% of all the food dye used in the U.S. According to the FDA , food coloring is used to: Because natural dyes are less shelf-stable than artificial ones, some food products may look different after the proposed switch is made. Naturally derived coloring is more susceptible to fading and degradation when exposed to elements like heat, light and air, so while foods may have the same general color profile, you may notice they appear less vibrant. Natural dyes are also generally more expensive to make and use, so companies changing their formulas to adhere to the FDA's requests may have to make adjustments to preserve their bottom line, though it is unclear if these additional costs could be passed on to the consumer.
