    "text": "- Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) to present seven abstracts at ASCO Annual Meeting 2025, showcasing key advancements in oncology.\n- Phase 3 IMforte trial reveals statistically significant survival benefits for Zepzelca and atezolizumab combination in small cell lung cancer.\n- New follow-up data highlight long-term outcomes for Ziihera in HER2-positive gastroesophageal cancer.\nJazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) has announced a significant presentation lineup at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in 2025. The company will feature seven abstracts, foregrounding pivotal advancements in the treatment of various cancers including small cell lung cancer, HER2-positive gastroesophageal cancer, and diffuse glioma.\nAmong the key highlights, the Phase 3 IMforte trial has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the combination of Zepzelca (lurbinectedin) and atezolizumab as a first-line maintenance therapy for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. These promising results have been the basis for a recent supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA.\nAdditionally, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has reported four-year follow-up data from a Phase 2 trial of Ziihera (zanidatamab-hrii) combined with chemotherapy, revealing promising long-term outcomes in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.\nThe company also showcased new efficacy and safety findings for dordaviprone (ONC201) in treating adult and pediatric patients suffering from recurrent H3 K27M-mutant diffuse glioma. This compound addresses a significant unmet medical need, as no FDA-approved alternatives currently exist for this patient population.\nTo provide a comprehensive review of these groundbreaking data, Jazz Pharmaceuticals will host an investor webcast on June 10, 2025, at 4:30 p.m. ET. This event will feature insights from leading oncology experts and key members of Jazz’s senior management team.",
