    "text": "Mr. Gary Schellenberg reports\nORIGEN EXTENDS LITHIUM TARGET AREA BY 3 SQUARE KILOMETERS AT LOS SAPITOS\nOrigen Resources Inc. has provided an update on the successful completion of the exploration program on its 100-per-cent-owned, 26,962-hectare district-scale Los Sapitos lithium project in San Juan province, Argentina.\nThe program was successful in identifying several new clay and brine targets within the same tectonic corridor that the Los Sapitos salar is situated. These new targets are over three kilometres (km) from the previously known Los Sapitos targets and significantly extends the company's priority exploration target area.\nMapping and sampling were focused within a five km radius of the Los Sapitos salar. Newly identified beds of evaporitic or hot spring associated carbonate indicates that there is greater scale and complexity to the basin surrounding Los Sapitos than was previously recognized. The similarity of the rocks at these new targets to the carbonate cap seen above the more concentrated brines at Los Saptios suggests multiple cycles of evaporite deposits over the basins history. These are interpreted by the company as positive prospective features.\nA total of 56 clay, four brines and six carbonate rock samples were collected during the program. All samples have been shipped to the University of San Juan's (Institute of Mining Research department) laboratory for further analysis. Crews were also successful in ground truthing proposed drill locations on the Los Sapitos salar in preparation for a future drill program.\nExploration plans for 2025\nOrigen is planning to follow up on its successful exploration program at Los Sapitos with a geophysical program over the newly identified areas of interest. This program will help delineate the basin configuration and guide future drilling.\nWith gold hitting historic highs, the company will also be exploring its high-grade gold Wishbone project, located adjacent to the Galore Creek project in British Columbia's Golden Triangle region.\nBudgets and details of these programs are in the planning stage and will be financed through further non-core divestitures of assets and a future private placement.\nIntegra Capital transaction update\nOrigen will not be proceeding with the transaction with Integra Capital Business SA as previously announced on Oct. 7, 2024. Unfortunately, after 15 months of talks, final transaction terms have not been agreed to between the two companies and the underlying property vendor of Los Sapitos. The parties continue to have exploratory discussions on how to mutually benefit from the development of the Argentinian assets.\nAbout Origen Resources Inc.\nOrigen is fully focused on its 100-per-cent interest in the Los Sapitos Lithium project in Argentina and its 100-per-cent-owned gold-silver Wishbone project in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia, along with a property portfolio of three 100-per-cent-owned precious and base metal projects in Southern British Columbia.\nThomas Hawkins, PGeo, a qualified person as that term is defined in National Instrument 43-101, has prepared, supervised the preparation or approved the scientific and technical disclosure in the news release.\nWe seek Safe Harbor.\n© 2025 Canjex Publishing Ltd.
