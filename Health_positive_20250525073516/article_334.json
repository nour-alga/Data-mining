    "text": "No increased costs for patients in new UF Health-United Healthcare deal, officials say\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - UF Health patients with United Healthcare should not see any increased costs passed on to them after a new agreement was reached.\nThe new 18-month health insurance agreement has a built-in renewal and eliminates what UF Health says are administrative obstacles, including waiting on getting authorizations for certain procedures.\n“This is a great thing for the patients who have been calling us and wanting to be seen,” said Dr. Marvin Dewar, the CEO of UF Health Physicians. “It’s a good thing for the community. It’s a good thing for our hospitals and our providers. So, it will be back to clinical care as usual for united patients, and I am happy about that.”\nRELATED: UF Health, United Healthcare reach deal after months of negotiations\nThe new agreement starts May 5 and restores network access to all U-F Health hospitals, facilities, and physicians.\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter.\nCopyright 2025 WCJB.
