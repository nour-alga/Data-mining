    "text": "Key Takeaways The antiviral baloxavir significantly reduced household transmission of influenza compared with placebo. The drug showed consistent effects across age groups, virus types, and countries, with no new safety concerns. Experts caution that baloxavir resistance and limited data on novel flu strains remain key challenges. A single dose of the antiviral baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) led to a lower incidence of influenza virus transmission to household contacts compared with placebo, a phase IIIb randomized trial showed.\nFive days after receiving the intervention, the adjusted incidence of transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 9.5% with baloxavir compared with 13.4% with placebo (adjusted OR 0.68, 95.38% CI 0.50-0.93, P =0.01), resulting in an adjusted relative risk reduction of 29%, reported Arnold Monto, MD, of the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nThe adjusted incidence of transmission of influenza virus by day 5 that resulted in symptoms was 5.8% with baloxavir and 7.6% with placebo, but this difference was not significant (adjusted OR 0.75, 95.38% CI 0.50-1.12, P =0.16). However, the authors noted that the incidence in the placebo group was lower than their a priori assumptions from sample-size calculations, \"possibly because of COVID-19 pandemic-related behavioral changes leading to fewer cases for evaluation.\"\n\"Most members of the households in this trial were mainly unvaccinated, and how previous vaccination may affect the incidence of transmission after baloxavir treatment remains unclear,\" Monto and team wrote. \"In a pandemic, development of a vaccine would take time, and the availability of an antiviral drug that reduces disease severity and person-to-person transmission could serve as a new element to combat such a pandemic.\"\n\"Although vaccines will remain the primary control measure for influenza epidemics and pandemics, antiviral drugs play a complementary role, particularly in a pandemic scenario, as well as in persons who are not vaccinated seasonally,\" they added.\nMonto and colleagues reported that the difference in transmission incidence favoring baloxavir occurred \"across age groups, seasons, influenza types (A[H1N1pdm09], A[H3N2], and B), times from symptom onset to receipt of baloxavir or placebo, and geographic regions. The matching of influenza subtype and the timing of the trial assessments mitigate the low likelihood of transmission from a nonhousehold source of infection during the follow-up period, which would dilute the treatment effect.\"\nIn an accompanying editorial , Timothy M. Uyeki, MD, MPH, of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and co-authors suggested that it's unclear how baloxavir might perform with novel influenza A viruses.\n\"Data are lacking on the efficacy, effectiveness, appropriate dose administration, or duration of baloxavir use for the treatment or post-exposure prophylaxis of novel influenza A viruses of pandemic potential, including highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, which limits the use of baloxavir in real-world public health strategies,\" they wrote.\n\"During the early phase of an influenza pandemic, when pandemic influenza vaccines are not yet available, early treatment with baloxavir, with its ability to decrease viral shedding, might have greater benefit in reducing transmission than when it is used for seasonal influenza, because most exposed persons will lack specific immunity to the pandemic influenza virus and household transmission is expected to be high,\" they noted.\nThough 7.2% of index patients showed emergence of drug-resistant viruses during follow-up, none of these viruses were detected in household contacts. \"All influenza antiviral drugs exert a selective pressure on viruses, which can result in the emergence of drug-resistant variants,\" Monto and team explained.\nStill, the potential for baloxavir resistance is a concern, the editorialists noted.\n\"Transmission of influenza viruses with reduced baloxavir susceptibility has been uncommon, but transmission of drug-resistant viruses remains a public health concern for all antiviral medications,\" they wrote. \"Thus, ongoing global surveillance for drug-resistant influenza virus is essential to inform antiviral use.\"\nThis study, conducted during the 2019-2024 flu seasons across multiple countries, involved 1,457 index patients ages 5-64 who were randomly assigned to receive baloxavir or placebo in the first 48 hours after symptom onset, as well as 2,681 household contacts.\nBaloxavir was given to 726 index patients, while 731 received placebo. The primary analysis population of index patients included 548 in the baloxavir group (mean age 30.8, 54.7% female) and 544 in the placebo group (mean age 31.8, 51.1% female).\nNo new safety concerns were reported in treated index patients.",
