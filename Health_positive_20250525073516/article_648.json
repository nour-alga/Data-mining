    "text": "Jeju Local Tea House Recovery House will present \"Jeju Wellness Premium Travel.\"\n\"Jeju Wellness Premium Travel\" is a local travel package that combines three experiences of tasting premium tea courses, forest drives and walks, and making handmade yokang with local ingredients.\nThe package was organized by local teams gathered to support the commercial district of Jeju, focusing on the recovery Daok, along with Naver's Happy Bean \"Shall We Go?\"\nUnlike existing travel products centered on Jeju City, it contains aspirations to see and feel Seogwipo anew while introducing a sustainable Jeju trip that blends nature and local.\n\"Jeju Wellness Premium Travel\" runs for about 4 hours every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 9 a.m. Up to 10 people can participate, and it will be held at a 30% discount for a month in May.\nThe trip begins with a breakfast made with Jeju local ingredients. It consists of soup made from Jeju field crops, udo peanut tofu bread and two kinds of handmade spreads, tomato plum syrup lemon marinade, and rice cake coated with camellia oil.\nThe following schedule is 'Premium Tea Care Set', the representative program of the Reclamation House. It is operated alone in the collection rooftop room without moving to a location.\n\"Premium tea-tasting\" is a private tea tasting program that offers Jeju leaf tea and flower tea grown in Jeju tea fields by eco-friendly farming methods, and tea food made from Jeju raw materials.\nThe entire tea course is conducted directly with the description of the tea in the recovery hall. Some dasik and tea are served in Jeju Onggi, a traditional porcelain made of Jeju volcanic soil, stimulating sight, touch, and taste at the same time.\nParticipants can enjoy the aesthetics of slowness and silence that are easy to miss in a busy daily life by focusing on tea and dasik in a quiet space.\nAfter eating and tea, a calm walk time at Seogwipo Natural Recreation Forest follows. Seogwipo Natural Recreation Forest is a representative healing spot where you can feel the green forest path, subtle birdsong, and even the texture of the wind.\nAlong with a simple guide from a professional forest commentator, enjoy a forest drive for about 10 minutes along the vehicle circulation path, and climb along wooden decks and low stairs for about 15 minutes to hear a commentary on Seogwipo Forest.\nIn the last order, you will have the experience of making your own yokang that you tasted in the recovery hall.\nThe skin is thick and fragrant, traditionally used as medicinal and tea ingredients for traditional Jeju-made citrus \"Dengyuji (Dengyuja)\" and Sosodang make red bean paste directly from Sosodang.\nSeo Kyung-ae, CEO of Suji Daok, said, \"I recommend it to those who dream of a mother-daughter trip where mothers and daughters sit face to face with each other and share their hearts with a cup of tea, or a special friendship trip where they walk in nature with special friends or acquaintances and make memories.\"\nThe Tea House Reclamation House, which opened in May 2024, is named after the old place name \"Doraemul,\" which means \"where the water flows.\" It was selected as a Jeju wellness tourist destination in 2024.",
