    "text": "Portland\n13 beds added to sobering center in Southeast Portland\n1 hours ago\nPORTLAND, Ore. — More sobering stations are opening up at Multnomah County's main deflection hub. The county announced on Wednesday that an additional 13 beds have been added to the Coordinated Care Pathway Center in Southeast Portland. The temporary center serves as an alternative to jail, where people who are intoxicated and detained can sober up. Law enforcement can also drop off people with small amounts of illegal drugs who are eligible for deflection to connect them to treatment and recovery services.\n2",
