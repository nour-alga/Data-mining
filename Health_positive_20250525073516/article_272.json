    "text": "Wisconsin lawmakers, health care workers call for more funding\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Elected officials met with health care workers Wednesday to highlight the need to invest in the health care workforce.\nSenate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein and Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer joined health care workers represented by SEIU Wisconsin to call for support for health care workers who are doing more with less. SEIU represents thousands of essential workers in Wisconsin.\nSEIU leaders say Wisconsin health care workers are providing critical care to people, while also facing burnout, low wages and staffing shortages.\n“We need a state budget that ensures care workers don’t pay the price, and our fellow Wisconsinites don’t lose the care that they depend on,” said SEIU President Pat Raes.\nThe group said federal Medicaid cuts looming make it more important than ever for Wisconsin to protect and strengthen the Medicaid system.\nAfter the press conference, SEIU Wisconsin members who work in health care participated in a lobbying day to push for lawmakers to fund frontline health care.\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 WMTV.
