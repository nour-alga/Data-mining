    "text": "WARWICK, R.I. (WJAR) — A 100-year-old organization in Warwick is a lifeline for children and senior citizens alike.\nIn-Sight makes life better for the blind and sight impaired, and the organization serves about 1,000 people a year.\nIt's 4-year-old Amias' first visit to In-Sight.\nOptometrist Dr. Greg Waldorf evaluates his albinism, which affects his vision.\nBut for Amias, it's just a chance to play.\n\"I'm just playing with toys,\" he said.\nOn the other side of the building, In-Sight Executive Director Christopher Butler is giving Lois Cuddy and Doreen Holmes, both sight-impaired, a tour of a training apartment.\n\"We want you guys to be independent in the kitchen, but we want you to be safe,\" Butler said.\n\"Bump dots\" -- raised stick-on bubbles on the microwave -- help users identify the controls by touch, and they learn hands-on knife skills lessons.\nIn-Sight has raised the confidence of Cuddy, a retired University of Rhode Island professor.\n\"With the techniques they teach you here, you can do anything,\" Cuddy said.\nNew technology has been a game changer for the blind, and at In-Sight, they'll even show you how to use it.\nRay-Ban Meta sensory glasses can describe what the wearer sees.\n\"You’re looking at a person holding a camera on a tripod,\" a voice from the glasses says.\nThere's a store with everything from magnifiers to white canes to a blind Barbie doll.\nThe clients go on trips together. Children go to camp.\nHolmes said she told her eye doctor that she wanted to teach yoga.\n\"He said, 'What’s stopping you?'\" she recalled. \"And I said, 'I guess nothing.'\"\nAnd now, people line up for her class.\nIn-Sight is celebrating 100 years this year. It's been around so long that even Hellen Keller visited in the 1930s.\nIf you know of a nonprofit that deserves some recognition, fill out the short nomination form for \"Community Treasures.\"",
