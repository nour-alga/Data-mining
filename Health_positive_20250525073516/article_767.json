    "text": "KBRA assigns a long-term rating of AA+, with a Stable Outlook, to the Harris County Hospital District, TX (the \"District\") Limited Tax Bonds, Series 2025.\nKey Credit Considerations\nThe rating was assigned because of the following key credit considerations:\nCredit Positives\n- The District is the primary safety net healthcare provider in the County and plays an essential role within the County’s public health mission.\n- A growing tax base continues to generate strong property tax revenues for the District, thus supporting voter-authorized debt obligations.\n- District’s ad valorem tax rate remains well below the constitutional limit.\nCredit Challenges\n- Large capital plan that will place upward pressure on operating expenses, debt requirements and the tax levy.\n- Managing potential operational challenges should federal Medicaid funding materially decline.\nRating Sensitivities\nFor Upgrade\n- Material growth in the property tax base, which supports the District’s revenue and operations and bolsters the taxing capacity within the Constitutional levy limit.\nFor Downgrade\n- Significant secular deceleration or declines in tax base growth pressuring ad valorem tax support.\n- Trend of sharply increasing operating deficits requiring substantial increases in the M&O tax rate.\nTo access ratings and relevant documents, click here.\nMethodologies\nDisclosures\nA description of all substantially material sources that were used to prepare the credit rating and information on the methodology(ies) (inclusive of any material models and sensitivity analyses of the relevant key rating assumptions, as applicable) used in determining the credit rating is available in the Information Disclosure Form(s) located here.\nInformation on the meaning of each rating category can be located here.\nFurther disclosures relating to this rating action are available in the Information Disclosure Form(s) referenced above.
