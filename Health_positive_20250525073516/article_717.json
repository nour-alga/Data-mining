    "text": "Mineralys Therapeutics (MLYS, Financial) has reported encouraging outcomes from its pivotal Phase 2 Advance-HTN trial. The study, which focused on patients with uncontrolled hypertension (uHTN) or resistant hypertension (rHTN), examined the efficacy of lorundrostat. The findings, recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, highlight significant improvements in blood pressure management.\nLorundrostat, administered at a 50 mg dose, achieved a notable 15.4 mmHg absolute reduction and a 7.9 mmHg placebo-adjusted decrease in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure by week 12 of the trial. Importantly, the drug demonstrated effectiveness across various groups, including patients on two or more baseline medications, as well as among different demographics such as men, women, whites, and blacks.\nThe treatment not only showed promising results in managing blood pressure but also maintained a favorable safety profile. Observed changes in potassium, sodium, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were modest, indicating good tolerability.\nMineralys is set to release further data from the pivotal Phase 3 Launch-HTN trial at an upcoming medical conference, with plans to publish the results in a peer-reviewed journal. The ongoing Transform-HTN open-label extension trial continues to offer participants the opportunity to receive lorundrostat, allowing for the collection of additional safety and efficacy data.\nWall Street Analysts Forecast\nBased on the one-year price targets offered by 7 analysts, the average target price for Mineralys Therapeutics Inc (MLYS, Financial) is $40.00 with a high estimate of $52.00 and a low estimate of $26.00.
