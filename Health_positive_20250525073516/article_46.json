    "text": "The Shapiro administration today announced that Pennsylvania American Water was awarded a grant and a low-interest loan from the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) totaling $9,527,990. The funding will support one of the company’s lead service line replacement projects in the City of New Castle, Lawrence County.\n“At Pennsylvania American Water, we strive to provide our customers with high-quality, reliable water services while also meeting environmental standards and regulations. We’re thankful to PENNVEST for approving this funding request that will support us in that mission,” said Pennsylvania American Water Vice President of Engineering Tony Nokovich. “This project will have a positive impact on the service provided for our customers by enabling us to continue our efforts to remove lead service lines.”\nThe PENNVEST grant of $5,565,850 and $3,962,140 loan will fund the replacement of approximately 550 identified lead water service lines in New Castle. The removal of all leaded components will provide direct water quality improvements to customers and is consistent with regulatory and Pennsylvania American Water initiatives to eliminate lead-containing lines from the public water supply system.
