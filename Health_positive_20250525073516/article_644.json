    "text": "Black Dog Institute has welcomed the Federal Labor Government's election commitment to invest $2 million into research focused on men's mental health, as part of a broader $32 million commitment to support men's health initiatives.\nIf re-elected, the Labor Government will invest $2 million in research led by Black Dog Institute at the Danny Frawley Centre in Victoria to advance our understanding of men's mental health and drive new approaches to prevention and early intervention.\n\"Rates of mental ill health continue to rise amongst Australian men. This funding will allow us to better understand why this is happening and, crucially, to develop new interventions that can get the best available help to men when and where they need it,\" says Black Dog Institute Executive Director and Chief Scientist Professor Samuel Harvey.\nThe announcement follows Black Dog Institute's recent acquisition of the Danny Frawley Centre Community—strengthening the scientific foundation of the Danny Frawley Centre and expanding the reach and impact of both organisations' mental health and wellbeing programs across Victoria and beyond.\nAs a globally recognised leader in translational research, Black Dog Institute focuses not only on new discoveries in mental health but also on ensuring those discoveries are transformed into real-world solutions that reach people who need them most.\nThis commitment signals important recognition of the role research plays in transforming prevention, improving early intervention, and ensuring more men across Australia have access to effective, relevant mental health support.",
