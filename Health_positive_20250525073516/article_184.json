    "text": "Wisconsin Democrats introduces bill to increase access to abortion\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to increase access to abortion in Wisconsin on Wednesday.\n“Abortion Rights Restoration Act” would eliminate barriers to abortion care.\nThe legislation would also create a statute to protect each person’s right to make their own reproductive health care decisions.\n“This legislation is about making a future here in Wisconsin where everyone has access to the health care they need, where every single person has the ability to thrive,” Democratic State Senator Kelda Roys said.\nWMTV reached out to Speaker Robin Vos, who released this statement regarding the legislation.\nIt is not clear when or if this bill would be taken up this legislative session.\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 WMTV.
