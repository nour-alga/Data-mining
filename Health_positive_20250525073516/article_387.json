    "text": "Riversgold (ASX: RGL) has enlarged the shallow gold mineralisation associated with its Kalgoorlie East project with the latest results from drilling at the site's Northern Zone porphyry.\nVertical aircore drilling of 32 holes for a total of 1,805 metres has intersected the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validated the broader gold mineralisation model.\nAll holes on the eastern extension intersected significant mineralisation and returned some of the highest gold grades yet seen at the project.\nBest aircore assays\nBest assays were 10m at 8.89 grams per tonne gold from 46m including 1m at 77.96g/t from 54m and 7m at 3.14g/t gold from 47m including 1m at 18.35g/t from 50m.\nOther results featured 5m at 1.26g/t gold from 46m including 2m at 2.74g/t from 49m, 12m at 0.80g/t gold from 32m…\nImelda Cotton",
