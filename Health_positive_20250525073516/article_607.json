    "text": "ADMA Biologics Soars 1.59% on Strong Earnings, Technical Performance\nADMA Biologics (ADMA) surged 1.59% today, marking its second consecutive day of gains, with a total increase of 10.64% over the past two days. The share price reached its highest level since November 2024, with an intraday gain of 6.26%.\nADMA Biologics' recent stock price movements can be attributed to several key factors. The company has demonstrated strong technical performance, with a high technical rating of 10 out of 10. This rating indicates positive long-term and short-term trends, with the stock outperforming 99% of all stocks and 98% within the Biotechnology industry. The increased trading volume suggests heightened investor interest, as the stock is trading near the high of its recent range.\nIn terms of growth and profitability, [adma biologics] has shown significant improvements. The company reported a 275% quarter-to-quarter EPS increase and a 485% year-over-year EPS growth.
