    "text": "City honors cancer community at Arbor Day ceremony\nTRUMANN, Ark. (KAIT) - A tree planted in Poinsett County honors cancer patients, survivors, and loved ones who lost their lives fighting the disease.\nA proclamation from Mayor Jay Paul Woods deems April 23, 2025, as Arbor Day to support efforts to protect trees and woodlands in the city of Trumann.\nStudents, teachers, and city officials gathered around a new tree planted at Trumann Elementary School, where fourth-grade teacher Chea Palmer is actively going through breast cancer treatment.\nPalmer said doctors caught it early, but she encourages all women to get mammograms regularly.\n“I was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer in January, and I had a double mastectomy at the end of February,” Palmer said. “And so far, I’m showing cancer-free.”\nGrown with gratitude and never forgotten, the city said the tree symbolizes strength in the face of struggle, healing through hope, and love that never fades.\nTo report a typo or correction, please click here.\nCopyright 2025 KAIT.
