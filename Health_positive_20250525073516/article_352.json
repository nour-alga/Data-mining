    "text": "GB News\nThe 80-year-old works out regularly, doing 120 press-ups every day\nTrending on GB News\nMultiple factors influence longevity, including diet, genetics, lifestyle choices, the environment, and gender.\nAn 80-year-old has shared how he has lived a long life and kept in \"really good shape,\" crediting his diet, lifestyle choices, and a drink he has every morning.\nGary Leffew, who is a former world champion bull rider, explained how he starts his day with \"ginger tea\".\nHe said: \"I grind up ginger and then steep it in hot water. It is good for inflammation, and after 20 years of riding bulls, you get a lot of bangs and broken bones.\nGary still works out often and encourages people to keep moving\nYouTube/GaryLeffew\n\"Ginger tea is really good for you, and it is important you take care of your body\".\nAlongside drinking his ginger tea, the octogenarian aims to maintain a very healthy diet by cutting out processed foods and opting for natural foods.\nHe eats free-range eggs from the ducks and chickens on his farm and consumes wild-caught salmon and tuna, which he has \"tonnes of\".\nHe said: \"Anything that goes into my body has got to keep me healthy because at 80 years old, I have a belly like a rock, and my arms are still good. I [also] use coconut oil to cook with. Coconut oil is perfect for you.\"\nAside from diet, the former bull rider aims to stay as active as possible and recommended that people remain mobile as they age.\nGary explained: \"Every day, I come out and do three sets of 40 push-ups. I go to the gym a couple of times a week, but I do not have time to go more.\n\"There are not many 80-year-olds doing what I do. My whole goal is to live well past 100. Once I get there, maybe even go further than that.\"\nBefore starting his workouts, the octogenarian begins with some deep breathing \"to get a lot of oxygen in [his] system\".\nThe former bull rider eats a healthy diet with no processed foods\nYouTube/GaryLeffew\nHe advised: \"Oxygen is the only thing that is free these days, so taking deep breaths is really good for you.\"\nIn other longevity news, a 90-year-old has revealed her secret to longevity is daily exercise, telling others that \"if you don't use it, you'll lose it\".\nA TikTok creator who goes by Gluten Free Gut Health Girl (@connievalentinecurrie) introduced her mother on the sharing platform.\nShe said to viewers: \"Want to stay strong for life? Listen to tips from my 90-year-old mum.\"",
