    "text": "A new study\npublished in Social Indicators Research found that pet companionship leads to a 3 to 4 points boost in life satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 7. Additionally, the value of a pet was calculated as the equivalent of earning $100,000 USD per year in added life satisfaction. These aren't small improvements in quality of life – they're huge.\nRELATED:\nThe 20 Most Dog-Friendly Countries In The World.\nThe UK-based researchers Michael W. Gmeiner and Adelina Gschwandtner built on\nearlier research that has found animals can reduce stress symptoms for humans. For example, the simple action of petting or viewing an animal has been shown to decrease blood pressure and heart rate.\nGmeiner and Gschwandtner used survey data from the\nUK Household Longitudinal Study to form the basis of their work. That survey of more than 700 people looked at the correlation of demographic data with pet ownership, along with personality traits and social behavior. The emotional impact and longterm effects of pet ownership are particularly notable.\nThe research applied to both cats and dogs, and there wasn't any added benefit of one over the other (so the\ncats vs. dogs debate can rage on). While other pets like fish, rabbits, and reptiles are believed to have significance, there was not enough data to make conclusions on their benefits.\nPets have a \"calming presence\" and \"ease feelings of loneliness,\"\nper UC Davis Health. It's part of why pet therapy has become so popular and it's a proven effective strategy to care for elderly, leading to better integration and socialization skills, creating a deeper feeling of belonging and sharing, and improving quality of life.\nPets have\nadditional benefits for children, such as teaching them about responsibilities, taking their mind off of stressful situations, and creating a bond for social interaction.\nThe new research puts a monetary value on that satisfaction of having a pet, which is on par with a happy\nmajor life event like marriage.\nWhat are the main benefits of pets for mental health?\nThe research is also in line with the\nAmerican Heart Association's list of five benefits of pets for mental health:\n- Reduce work-related stress.\n- Increase productivity.\n- Manage anxiety.\n- Be more active.\n- Create a sense of togetherness.\nHow many Americans have a pet?\nOf 128 million households, an estimated 94 million (73%) own a pet,\naccording to the 2025 APPA National Pet Owners Survey. That breaks down to mostly dogs (68 million) and cats (49 million) with fish, birds, reptiles, and horses in the mix at smaller levels.",
