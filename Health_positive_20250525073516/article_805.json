    "text": "Strategic Expansion Paired with Over $1M in Annual Cost Savings from Operational Restructuring\nPERTH, Australia , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Argent BioPharma Ltd. (ASX: RGT) (OTCQB: RGTLF), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in neuroimmune therapies, is pleased to announce its official entry into the German pharmaceutical market with the receipt of initial purchase orders for CannEpil® and CogniCann®, following recent regulatory approval. Germany , as the largest healthcare market in Europe , represents a significant commercial milestone and a strategic beachhead for Argent's broader European expansion.\nIn parallel, the Company has successfully completed the transfer of its EU GMP-certified manufacturing facilities in Slovenia and Malta to trusted third-party operators. This strategic operational shift allows Argent to maintain GMP compliance while reducing infrastructure overhead, resulting in annual operational cost savings exceeding USD $1 million . These efficiencies free up capital to further accelerate R&D initiatives and clinical trials across core therapeutic programs.\nThese achievements reflect Argent BioPharma's broader transformation strategy—centered on fully proprietary, neuroimmune drug development, in-house innovation, and sustainable global scalability. The Company remains focused on advancing its therapeutic pipeline while deepening market penetration across high-value regions.\nAbout Argent BioPharma\nArgent BioPharma Ltd. (ASX: RGT) develops proprietary therapeutics targeting central nervous system (CNS) and autoimmune disorders using its Neuro-Immune Modulatory (NIM) platform. Lead assets include CannEpil®, CogniCann®, and CimetrA®, which are now entering major European markets as part of a targeted international growth plan.\nContact:\nRoby Zomer\nCEO & Managing Director\n+61 8 6555 2950\n[email protected]\nRowan Harland\nCompany Secretary\n+61 8 6555 2950\n[email protected]\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/argent-biopharma-enters-germany--europes-largest-market-302435972.html\nSOURCE Argent BioPharma Ltd.",
